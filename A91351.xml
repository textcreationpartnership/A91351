            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>
               <hi>To all true Saints, in</hi> England <hi>and elſewhere, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally partakers of Spirit-Baptiſme in the Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, who is the way into the poſſeſſion, and injoyment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall grace and glory in the Lord JEHOVAH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FRiends in the truth, <hi>He that hath ſet his hand to the Plough and looketh back, is not fit for the Kingdome of God,</hi> And I muſt here declare unto you, that Gods Kingdom, that he will bring forth in theſe latter dayes is another manner of building and work, than the world or Churches under Antichriſts raign doth think of; for God is now pulling down the old building, that man hath been ſetting up, this many hundred years: and O friends, I would adviſe you, not to ſtand looking back upon the old building, in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Kingdome, but with the Apoſtle, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwells righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let us, who are of the day, go toward <hi>Zion,</hi> with our faces thither-ward: for looking back, hinders ſeeing what is before us. Let us look unto the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the living God, that cometh down from God out of heaven; and let us not ſo much, as take any notice of the old heavens, wherein men would aſcend up to God (for God hath not bid us look after the old, but the new, and hath bid us
<pb facs="tcp:118122:3"/> rejoyce for ever in the things that he will create, and he hath told us, that he that ſtands upon the Throne makes all things new.</p>
            <p>And this is a clear truth, that all the Churches and Church orders of men (as they call it) are yet in <hi>Babel,</hi> they are all in confuſion one with another, &amp; amongſt themſelves,
<hi>One ſaith here is Chriſt, and another ſaith, there is Chriſt,</hi> one for one way, another for another way, one for one order, another for another order, one interprets Scriptures one way, another another way; one ſaith, one thing is truth, and another ſaith, another thing is truth: and many cry out againſt the clear truth, and would, if it were poſſible, hinder that from appearing. And now how can you imagine that the Churches are out of <hi>Babel,</hi> and yet ſtill in confuſion, in darkneſſe, and miſtakes? Chriſts firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, brought diviſions into the world: but now it ſhall bring peace among all <hi>(Luke</hi> 12. 51.) Iſa.
11.</p>
            <p>Conſider a few particulars, wherein it doth appear, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is not yet fallen, but ſtandeth ſtill even to this day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When God brings forth his great work, in the latter dayes, <hi>The wolf and the lamb ſhall dwell together in peace,</hi> &amp;c. but now we are far from ſuch a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for thoſe who look like lambs, (and are ſo for ought I know) they cannot dwell together in peace and love, but are at great difference as well as the lamb and wolf, but perſecution ſhall come to an end in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, and not continue as before<hi>:</hi> therefore look not for ſuch a time now to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In that day the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> but it is now full of ignorance of the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:118122:3"/> as all carnall principles and doctrines of men do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with their works and actions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In that day, God will get his people a name and a praiſe in all lands where they have been put to ſhame:</hi> but yet they are a reproach in all Lands; therefore that day is not yet come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In that day God will turne to his people one pure language, wherein they ſhall all ſerve him with one conſent: and God will give them one heart and one way, the Lord ſhall be one and his name one &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But none of this is to be found, for we ſee even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that praiſe God, there are many langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and they ſerve God (according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ignorance) in many wayes, and there is no conſenting together: therefore Antichriſt is not yet deſtroyed, &amp; ſo we are yet in the wilderneſs &amp; in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Egypt and Sodom, where our Lord was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp;c. and as the great difference was between open profanneſſe and a forme of Godlineſſe: ſo now it is between the forme and the power of godlineſſe. Therefore the loftineſſe of man is not laid low, nor the Lord alone exalted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The promiſe is, that in that day the peace of Gods people ſhall be great, but now it is not ſo, for our diviſions are now great, and our peace little with men: then none ſhall diſturbe nor make them afraid but now there are many diſturbers, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cleare truth.</p>
            <p>Therefore Antichriſt is not yet deſtroyed, but doth oppoſe Chriſt in Spirit, and ſo Babel or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſtill preſent, therefore not the new heavens, and new earth the worke of God in this world, as is cleare by many witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:118122:4"/> 6. When Babylon is fallen, the kingdomes of the world ſhall become the kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, &amp; this muſt needs be in another manner of way then before, for all Nations are at Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing ſtill, even in the higheſt of Antichriſts raign. But we ſee not this yet fulfilled, for the kingdomes of the world are ſtill as they were, men are unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unholy, without love, pity and compaſſion to their fellow Creatures as they were, ſome have thouſands of Gold and Silver, and others want food and raiment &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This does not look like the righteouſneſſe of God in the new heavens and new earth, but like the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe of men in the old, tyrannical, cruell and oppreſſing kingdome of Antichriſt<hi>:</hi> this looks not like the love of Chriſt, but like ſelfe-love &amp;c. as in the Epiſtle of <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider farther the Church of Chriſt was to be droven into the wilderneſſe of Antichriſts kingdome, during his reigne, and the outward Court of the Temple was given to the Gentiles during Antichriſts reigne (and I hope you know what this is) therefore take not that unto your ſelves that is given to the Gentiles during Antichriſt's reigne, for you have no example ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>For the Jewes never ſet up viſible worſhip, nor ordinances in any time of Captivity, either in Egypt, the Wilderneſſe, Babylon, or elſe where, but in Jeruſalem the place of worſhip.</p>
            <p>So let us who are the Lords building within waite for the ſpirituall Jeruſalem comming downe from God out of heavens, which God will ſend forth with
<pb facs="tcp:118122:4"/> viſible worſhip and ordinances ſuch as pleaſeth him<hi>:</hi> (and not as man pleaſeth.)</p>
            <p>And as we deſire of friends to be the habitation of God through the Spirit, ſo let us deſire to be more acquainted with the Baptiſme of the Spirit, which conſiſts in ſpirituall waſhing, purifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſouls and ſpirits from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, that ſo in it we may be made partakers of eternall Righteouſneſſe, purity, and Holineſſe of God, and ſo builded up together, an habitation for God, and a Temple for the living God to dwell in, through the preſence of the eternall Spirit in us, in ſpiritual waſhing and ſpirituall burning, the true and onely Goſpel purifying.</p>
            <p>So I reſt, wiſhing the day of God may come upon us all, that may burne up all our droſſe and tynne, and may waſh and purge us from all our Idols, that we may worſhip God in ſpirit.</p>

            <head>A few words to every Reader in general.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Kind Reader, conſider a few things in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BE ſure thoſe Ordinances you doe owne and ſet up in your higheſt affections, be of God and not of man; for if they be of man, then they cannot ſtand in the day of Triall when, God brings them to triall by the Truth.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed of ſetting up Ordinances in the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, in ſpirituall
<hi>Babylon, Egypt</hi> or <hi>Sodome,</hi> leaſt it be found that you have noe Command, nor Example for your ſoe doing. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>3. Looke that your Adminiſtrators be right in their Calling, and Qualifications, according to the true patterne of the primitive Adminiſtrators, both in your Miniſtry and Ordinances, leaſt being tried by the word, they ſhould be found liars, take heed, I ſay, of crying up your ſelves and waies to be Apoſtolicall, leaſt the truth ſhould prove you lyars.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider this well, that the pure way of Goſpel-worſhip, that is truly ſpiritual, will never come out of Antichriſts kingdome, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, doctrines, nor traditions, but conſider that the bright day of Gods comming in ſpirit ſhall deſtroy the foundation and whole building of the man of ſinne and myſtery of iniquity,</p>
            <p>5. Truſt not to the old building of man in Antichriſts kingdome in theſe dayes, wherin God is rooting up, and pulling downe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and whole building of the old heavens and old earth: and God is alſo about to bring forth new heavens and new earth, wherein dwells Righteous, the work of God alone, in which day the Lord alone ſhall be exalted, and the loftineſſe of man laid low.</p>
            <p>6. Look well to your Principles, Rules, and ends for, and in whom, you do act in thoſe things you call Ordinances; beware of ſelf, and ignorant zeal, you have heard there is a zeal, and that for God too, that is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t according to knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118122:5"/> 7. Look not ſo much at outward forms, as at inward principles; look to the inward, and hidden man of the heart; if that be right, in the ſight of God, then it ſhall be well with you for ever, and you ſhall never be finally deceived.</p>
            <p>8. Beware of ſetting up the bounds of your love to the brethren, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any form, or opinion whatſoever, but let your love be equally unto all, where you do ſee the appearance of Chriſt in Spirit and power from on high, this is the way for peace, unity and love among true Saints.</p>
            <p>9. Look not for the true way of viſible worſhip and ordinances, that are truly ſpirituall and of God, to be eſtabliſhed in the world, till God hath made his people of one heart; and when God makes them all of one heart, <hi>(which ſhal be, when they are all taught of God)</hi> then they ſhall be all of one way, and great ſhall be their peace, then they ſhall all reſt in quiet dwelling places for ever, and none ſhall make them afraid.</p>
            <p>10. Conſider, when the way of God is clearly revealed in his people, and they endued with divine life and power to walk in it, then all by-paths and wayes, that are not of God, ſhall be deſtroyed, thrown down, and quite forgotten, (the old heavens and earth, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more, nor no more come into their minds, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.)</p>
            <p>But now we ſee, there are many wayes in the world, even amongſt thoſe that profeſſe to know God, one cryes up one way, another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, a third another way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us remember the command of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>Many ſhall come in his name, &amp;c. Many ſhall ſay, here is Chriſt, or there is Chriſt, but go not after them:</hi> If ye conſider theſe three Teſtimonies, of theſe latter dayes, whereby Chriſts coming, ſhall be manifeſted unto all, who are partakers of his light, in ſpirit and life, then you may eaſily diſcern the coming of Chriſt, and his light and brightneſſe from the falſe lights, and wayes of Antichriſt, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Matth.</hi>
24. 27. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>11. As every one doth walk in his own light, and thinks his light beſt, generally ſo take heed you do not imitate Antichriſt, to confine others to walk in your light. Take heed of ſitting in the Temple of God, it is proper onely to God alone, to rule our Conſciences, and ſpirits of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd whoſoever doth aſſume this Prerogative, doth apparently declare himſelf to be an Anticrhiſt, who doth oppoſe himſelf againſt God, and doth exalt himſelf above God, as in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4. and ſet in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:118122:6"/> of God <hi>(even his people)</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
            <p>12. Take heed of miſtaking the coming of Chriſt now, in theſe dayes, wherein Antichriſt ſhall be deſtroyed, leſt you ſhould imitate the old Scribes and Phariſees, and ſo inſtead of being friends of Chriſt, and of his people, in his Spirituall coming, you ſhould prove the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies to Chriſt, in his ſpirituall coming in his people, as the old Jews were.</p>
            <p>13. Take heed of ſlighting, refuſing, or undervaluing the pure, and ſpirituall waters of life, the onely fountain of comfort to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſouls, and beware you ſet not up any form or outſide ordinances, to oppoſe the clear adminiſtration of the Spirit, which is truly ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: for God will aſſuredly famiſh and make lean all your empty forms, Idols, and ſhadows that you ſet up, to oppoſe the ſubſtance, as in the room thereof, for the Kingdome of heaven is not outward ſhews, but inward Subſtances, Righteouſneſſe, Peace, and Joy in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>14. Beware in having any hand in ſlaying of the Witneſſes of God, that do propheſie, though but in Sackeloth; leſt their reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affright you, and ſtrike you with terror. For conſider, though they ſhall be ſlain, yet they ſhall ly dead, but a little while, and again, when God puts the Spirit of life in them, then they ſhall affright all thoſe that dwell upon the earth: beware then all thoſe that do live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earthen principles, Doctrines, Forms, Cuſtomes, and Traditions of men; they ſhall be all affrighted with a witneſſe; therefore look to it well, that the diſpenſations you live under be of God and not of man; for God will deſtroy all things below, himſelf, though never ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and highly eſteemed of man..</p>
            <p>So I conclude, wiſhing that we may all live in love now, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing love ſhall continue to Eternity, and let us conſider what a low thing it is for believers to live contrary to that which is their life, and in which we are all one body, and members in particular (which is Love.)</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beſt way to reconcile differences in the things of God, is to lay aſide all humane and traditionall Doctrines of men, and look ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly into the teſtimony of the word of God alone, that being an infallible Rule, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever follows it in the light, and wiſdome of the Eternall ſpirit, they cannot erre.</p>
            <p>And God having taught me not to depend upon man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrills, but to look unto the Lord a-alone, whoſe work alone it is to bring forth the new Creation; I deſire therefore, not to ſtand looking back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old building in the Wilderneſſe of Antichriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, after ſo long and generall Apoſtafie from the purity of the firſt Churches in the Apoſtles times.</p>
            <p>But my deſire is with the Apoſtle, to look for new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118122:8"/> and a new Earth, according to the promiſe of God, Even ſuch Heavens and Earth, where the righteouſneſſe of God doth dwell: and not ſuch righteouſneſſe as men ſets up by their humane Wiſdome and Counſel.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but theſe are the dayes wherein God will bring forth the clear light of truth, that hath been hid many generations, and let men ſet up what they will, or what man can ſet up, yet nothing ſhall ſtand in the bright day of Gods coming in ſpirit in theſe latter dayes, but the purity, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and righteouſneſſe of God, which is ſuitable to the new heavens, and new Earth, the work of God alone.</p>
            <p>And now among many other things in controverſie in our dayes<hi>:</hi> I find a great deal of difference about Baptiſme, and all for baptiſing with materiall water<hi>:</hi> ſome for Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and others for baptiſing believers.</p>
            <p>And I have (if God hath given me underſtanding in the myſtery of the truth) ſearched to find out the right way of Baptiſme, and I can find neither of theſe to be the way of Goſpel-Baptiſme, neither can I find by the Teſtimony of the word of truth, that there is any water Baptiſme at all to be uſed by way of Command, in the pure ſpirituall Kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But that water Baptiſme was at an end in reſpect of the command of it, when Chriſt was glorified, and came in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as all other Ceremonies, Types and Figures were.</p>
            <p>And I can find no other Baptiſme in Chriſts Kingdome to be in force, but the Baptiſme of the Eternall ſpirit, and this I affirm to be all, and the onely Baptiſme in the Kingdome of Chriſt;</p>
            <p>And to go about to ſet up any other Baptiſme in Chriſts Kingdome, is all one, as if men ſhould ſet up any other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, all which will alike prove humane and traditionall, not ſpiritual nor of divine Inſtitution, and for the proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſhall lay aſide all the Judgements, interpretations and opinions of men; who do caſually underſtand the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118122:8"/> And that we may ſee this to be clear truth from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the word alone; that the Baptiſme of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit is the onely Baptiſme in Chriſts Kingdome. Let us conſider the teſtimony Firſt of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> Secondly of Chriſt, And thirdly of the Apoſtles in their preaching and writing to the people, with the Objections of men alſo for water Baptiſme, and the anſwers againſt it, from the clear teſtimony of the word, and not from men, in theſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other particulars according to the word, I ſhall as God enables me proceed in this Diſcourſe; for the help of man is vain in the things of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, we will begin with the Teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> himſelf, who was the author of water Baptiſme; and ſee what he ſaith for his own Baptiſme, which was water, and what he ſaith of Chriſts Baptiſme, which is Spirit.</p>
            <p>Firſt in Generall, we will obſerve one thing that <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, and it is this; that he was ſent to baptiſe with water <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 33.</p>
            <p>Now let all our water-men in <hi>England,</hi> or in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come forth with their ſtrong reaſons, and bring one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the word of truth, that ſaith from Chriſt, that ever he ſent his Apoſtles to baptiſe with water, or elſe, where any Apoſtles do teſtifie in Scripture that Chriſt did give them a Commiſſion to baptiſe with water? <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every thing is eſtabliſhed,</hi> ſhew me but one ſuch witneſſe from any of the Apoſtles, as from <hi>Iohn,</hi> and I will believe it; but till you do ſo, I cannot believe you, we have witneſſe to the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. from the chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Johns</hi> buſineſſe was to declare Chriſt to come, that he ſhould be manifeſted to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> therefore am I come baptiſing with water ſaith he. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 31. Shew me ſuch a teſtimony from any Apoſtle, or elſe prove your ſelves Antichriſts, declaring Chriſt yet to come in the fleſh, who is already preſent in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but now to the witneſſe of <hi>John,</hi> concerning his own Baptiſme and Chriſts, as <hi>Matth.</hi>
3. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>John</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the teſtimuny of <hi>Iohn, Matth</hi> 3. 11. <hi>I indeed baptiſe you with water unto repentance,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn)</hi> but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118122:9"/> doth <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay this Baptiſm muſt continue? no, <hi>But he that cometh after me, is mightier than I;</hi> but ſhall his Baptiſme be water too? no ſaith
<hi>John,</hi> (as he is mightier, ſo his Baptiſme ſhall be mightier too) <hi>He ſhall baptiſe you with the holy ſpirit and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verſe 12. He declareth the power and efficacy of Chriſts Baptiſme, that ſo none may miſtake his meaning; for ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his Garner, but ſhall burn up the chaffe with unquenchable fire.</hi> Here is a clear teſtimony of the fire and water of the Spirit, that ſhall be powred out upon Souls in Chriſts Baptiſme, it ſhall throughly purge and cleanſe his people from their ſin and filthineſſe, and burn up all the chaffe and droſſe with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fire, which no combuſtible principle in the creature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quench or put out; but it ſhall deſtroy thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the fleſh and Spirit of man.</p>
            <p>This is the onely Baptiſme that <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Baptiſme, which was but an outward waſhing; this is that Judgement and Righteouſneſſe that ſhall redeem Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and her Converts from ſinne and all unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 27. This is that ſpirit of Judgement and burning, whereby the Lord ſhall waſh away the filth of the daughters of Zion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 4. Here is a diſcovery of the true waſhing or Baptiſme of the new Teſtament, all others went before, as we may ſee in the witneſſe of
<hi>Iohn</hi> here and elſe where, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſtood in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings and carnall Ordinances impoſed on them untill the time of Reformation.</p>
            <p>2. See another witneſſe of <hi>John, Mark, v.</hi> 4, 5, 7, 8. Here <hi>John</hi> baptiſeth with water, and declareth that there is one that cometh after him, that is mightier than he, <hi>&amp;c. I indeed</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have baptiſed you with water, but he ſhall baptiſe you with the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Here <hi>Iohn</hi> declares what his Baptiſm was, it was water, <hi>I have baptiſed you with water,</hi> and he alſo declareth what Chriſts Baptiſm ſhould be, but not one word of water, <hi>but he ſhall bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you with the holy Spirit.</hi> O that men had but eyes to ſee how clearly <hi>Iohn</hi> diſtinguiſheth betwixt his Baptiſme and Chriſts.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. In this place it is recorded that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118122:9"/> People did generally take <hi>Iohn</hi> to be the Chriſt, <hi>There was great reaſoning among them, whether he were the Chriſt or no? v.</hi> 15. John anſwers them all,
<hi>v.</hi> 16. that he was not the Chriſt, and upon what account they ſhould believe it, becauſe he did baptiſe with water, <hi>Iohn</hi> anſwered, ſaying unto them all, <hi>I indeed baptiſe you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whoſe ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e I am not worthy to unlooſe, he ſhall baptiſe you with the holy ſpirit and with fire,</hi> and ſo he goeth on to declare the powerfull effects of Chriſts Baptiſme (as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 12.)</p>
            <p>The people were then of the ſame principle generally that people are of now; to look upon the Baptiſme of Chriſt to be an outward waſhing with materiall water, but <hi>Iohn</hi> takes them off from their expectation, and tells them his Office and Perſon was weak, not to be compared with Chriſt and his Office<hi>: Indeed ſath he, I baptiſe with water, but one mightier than I cometh, &amp;c. he ſhall baptiſe you with the holy Spirit and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Iohn</hi> layeth himſelf and his Baptiſme low, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that he was not worthy to do the meaneſt thing in Chriſts Kingdom, (and then ſure <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme and Chriſts, was not all one,) and <hi>Iohn</hi> doth highly exalt Chriſt and his Baptiſme, and declareth as we have ſhewed before the great effects of Chriſts Baptiſme. <hi>v.</hi>
17.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>John</hi> 1. 15. In this Chapter <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtill continueth his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of himſelf and of Chriſt, ſaying, this is he of whom I ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>v.</hi>
19. to the 23. It is recorded, <hi>The Iews ſent Prieſts and Levites to examine Iohn, whether he were the Chriſt or who he was,</hi> and we have here <hi>Johns</hi> anſwer who he was, and v. 24. it is recorded that they who were ſent were of the Phariſees, verſe 25. we have their queſtion unto <hi>Iohn, that if he were not the Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. then why he did baptiſe? and here by the way we may obſerve, that men of a Phariſaicall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple look upon the Baptiſme of Chriſt to be an outward waſhing with materiall water, I wiſh men were not ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall now.</p>
            <p>But preſently <hi>John</hi> croſſeth their conceit, and telleth them, <hi>that he baptiſeth with water,</hi> and further tells them, <hi>that there ſtandeth one among them whom they know not, v.</hi> 26. Oh that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118122:10"/> all who do now profeſſe Chriſt (which is more than the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees did) were not ſo ignorant of Chriſt in the myſtery of his Baptiſme, as the Phariſees were, but to obſerve <hi>Johns</hi> Concluſion in the buſineſſe, he declareth. <hi>v.</hi> 33. the true Baptiſme of Chriſt, from the teſtimony of him that ſent <hi>John</hi> to baptiſe with water (and in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 2. we have a proof who it was that ſent him, even the word of God came unto him, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> V. 33. <hi>And I knew him not, but he that ſent me to baptiſe with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſcending from heaven and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptiſeth with the holy Spirit,</hi> and v. 34. He declareth, <hi>That he ſaw and bare record, that this is the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we ſee the teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> that he declareth himſelf and his Baptiſme to be weak, and Chriſt and his Baptiſme to be ſtrong and mighty, and to follow after his: therefore ſure, the Baptiſme of Chriſt is not materiall water, as <hi>Johns</hi> was, but if he could ſee truth in its own light, then they might ſee it as it is in it ſelf, but generally men are apt to look upon the word, as men have interpreted it for their own ends and intereſts, I doubt, for the moſt part, and ſo they look not upon it, as in it ſelf: but as it ſeems to be from men in their opinions and Judgements, and ſo what men of our Judgements have ſet up as truth; that we own, and what they do cry down, that we diſown, becauſe men ſay ſo, and think ſo.</p>
            <p>We come now to the teſtimony of Chriſt, concerning <hi>John,</hi> which we have recorded.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 10, 11.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Chriſt declares him to be more than a Prophet.</item>
               <item>2. He declares him to be <hi>The voice of one crying in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. As the Prophets had propheſied of him.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. He declares, <hi>That among thoſe that were born of women, there had not riſen up a greater than</hi> John.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>That he that is leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven is greater than</hi> John.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt it is to be conſidered wherein <hi>John</hi> was greater than all that went before him, <hi>greater then a Prophet, or more than a Prophet:</hi> And ſecondly wherein it doth appear that <hi>John</hi> was the leaſt in Chriſts Kingdome, or the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118122:10"/> Firſt <hi>John</hi> was greater than thoſe that went before him, in this reſpect; becauſe thoſe that propheſied of Chriſt, and thoſe that figured out Chriſt in theſe Ceremonies, they never ſaw Chriſt perſonally in the humane nature as <hi>John</hi> did, therefore not ſo great as <hi>John;</hi> for <hi>John</hi> pointed out Chriſt preſent, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> which none could do before him, becauſe Chriſt was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in perſon; and in this reſpect,
<hi>John</hi> was greater than thoſe that went before him.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>John</hi> was greater than thoſe that went before him, in this reſpect: becauſe of the rareneſſe of his Office; his Baptiſme was ſo rare, and of ſo high eſteem among the people, they thought him to be the Chriſt. Indeed his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was a more excellent Ceremony than any uſed before, becauſe he did in it repreſent the greateſt work that ever was wrought upon creatures in the world; even the Baptiſme of the eternall Spirit, given out in the name of Father, Son, and Spirit, in teſtimony of the full diſcovery of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of God unto the Sons of men, in no leſſe power, than all power in heaven and earth, and this was the onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that <hi>John</hi> did repreſent, figure out and declare to be at hand, both in his Baptiſme and in his Doctrine, and in this reſpect, <hi>John</hi> was greater than thoſe that went before him, for the rarer the thing ſignified is, the rarer and more excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent is the Signe.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee wherein it doth appear, that the leaſt in Chriſts Kingdome, or in the Kingdome of heaven is greater than he.</p>
            <p>1. The leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven is greater than <hi>John,</hi> becauſe the leaſt in Chriſts Kingdome, had a ſight and could teſtifie more or leſſe, that Chriſt was crucified, dead and riſen, and had accompliſhed the whole work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was glorified, which <hi>John</hi> could not teſtifie as done. Every one in Chriſts Kingdome was an eye-witneſſe more or leſſe of the great pourings out of the Spirit upon all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Chriſt was glorified<hi>:</hi> as the Father had promiſed after, Chriſt had declared, and
<hi>John</hi> repreſented in his Baptiſme, and in this reſpect <hi>John</hi> was leſſe than the leaſt in Chriſts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118122:11"/> Kingdome, becauſe he did but figure out and declare thoſe great things to come, but was not an eye-witneſſe of them as they were; he living but in the middle diſpenſation, which went before, for as <hi>John</hi> was greater than thoſe that went before him, ſeeing they did but figure out, and propheſie of the Meſſiah, whom <hi>John</hi> ſaw in Perſon<hi>:</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> was leſſe than thoſe that were Eye-witneſſes of the great pourings out of Spirit, which <hi>John</hi> did but declare to be at hand, not come.</p>
            <p>3 Thoſe that lived in the Kingdome of Chriſt were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>John</hi> in this reſpect; becauſe they were partakers of thoſe great things, that <hi>John</hi> figured out in his Baptiſme; for the diſpenſation they lived in, in the Kingdome of Chriſt, was wholly ſpirituall, and they did partake of the great pourings out of Spirit, which was not to be accompliſhed, till Chriſt was glorified, which <hi>John</hi> did declare to be at hand, and figured out in an outward waſhing: for though <hi>John</hi> had a clear fight of Chriſt, and declared him very clearly in his miniſtry, yet his Office was but an outſide, figurative waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as other Ceremonies were, onely more excellent than others, as we have declared before, but thoſe who lived in a diſpenſation wholly ſpirituall, were greater than <hi>John,</hi> becauſe the ſubſtance is greater than the ſhadow: and thus we ſee briefly, wherein
<hi>John</hi> was greater and leſſer than thoſe that went before him, and thoſe that followed after him.</p>
            <p>But now we come to the next thing, which is the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt concerning his own Baptiſme, and this we have recorded in ſeverall places of Scripture, as in <hi>Matth.</hi>
28<hi>:</hi> 19. the Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Apoſtles; the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God opened to the Sons of men, in the third and laſt diſpenſation, by him who had power in heaven and earth gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, compared with all other places; and now we are to be tryed by the truth alone concerning the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Chriſt, and what it is, and not by man, as mans te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Matth,</hi> 28. We have Chriſt coming to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, declaring <hi>v.</hi>
18. <hi>all power in heaven and earth to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,</hi> and upon this <hi>v.</hi> 19. gives them the Commiſſion, <hi>Go ye</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118122:11"/> 
               <hi>therefore and teach all nations,</hi> or make Diſciples in all Nations, baptiſing them, in, or into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſover I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you alwayes, even unto the end of the world, or of an age, (and here let us obſerve, the Nations are, not taught or made Diſciples by baptiſing into water, but by baptiſing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of Father, Son and Spirit: and further obſerve a clear diſtinction in the Commiſſion. Firſt the Nations are to be taught or made diſciples in their miniſtry in which they were to be baptiſed into the name of God: and afterward they are to teach them to obſerve all things Chriſt hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; ſo that firſt they are to be baptiſed into the name of God, and afterward they are to be taught to obſerve all the commands of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So here we ſee Chriſt gives his Apoſtles a Commiſſion to <hi>go teach all Nations, baptiſing them into the name of God, &amp;c.</hi> and we have another proof, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.
49. when the Apoſtles muſt go forth in the accompliſhing his great work of baptiſing the Nations into the name of God, it was when they wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power from on high; for they were not able of themſelves to effect this great work, without power from on high, and this was the promiſe of the Father, as Chriſt ſaith here, ſo that it is clear, that the promiſe of the Father, and the power from on high is all one, and it is called the Baptiſme of the Spirit; and is onely ſuitable to a Spirituall diſpenſation, which is given forth in all power in heaven and earth, by him who had received all power for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this work,</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. we have another Teſtimony of Chriſt, wherein he doth clearly diſtinguiſh between his Baptiſme that is Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, and <hi>Johns</hi> that was water, and bids them wait for the Baptiſme of the Spirit, and being aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, commanded them they ſhould not depart from <hi>Jeruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which ſaith he, <hi>Ye have heard of me:</hi> (now the next words declare, what this promiſe of the Father was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For John truly baptiſed with water, but yet ſhall be baptiſed with</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118122:12"/> 
               <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> not many dayes hence. O that men could ſee this witneſſe of the truth, in the light and Wiſdome of the Spirit, how clearly Chriſt diſtinguiſheth betwixt his Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and that of <hi>John,</hi> and bids his Apoſtles wait for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his Baptiſme, according to the promiſe of the Father, and himſelf.</p>
            <p>But here it will be ſaid, that this Baptiſme was to be wrought upon the Apoſtles, by an immediate power of God, and not by man, therefore this is not the Baptiſme the Apoſtles were to uſe by command from Chriſt; but let us in the light of God conſider, it was requiſite the Apoſtles ſhould be baptiſed, Firſt with power from on high, by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate power, that the promiſe might be fulfilled, and alſo that they might be able to fulfill the Miniſtry committed to them, and I ſhall declare one proof, that the people were baptiſed with the ſame Baptiſme the Apoſtles were in the miniſtry of the Apoſtle, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 15, 16. &amp;c. <hi>And as I began to ſpeak, the holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning, then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he ſaid,</hi> John <hi>indeed baptiſed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but ye ſhall be baptiſed with the holy Spirit;</hi> (this is not non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as ſome call it, but the clear teſtimony of the truth) the Apoſtles were baptiſed in this Baptiſme, by an immediate power, and the people were afterward baptiſed with the ſame ſpirit Baptiſme, by a mediate power in the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, the promiſe of ſpirit Baptiſme was to them and their children, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 2. 33, 39. compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore take heed of wreſting the Commiſſion of Chriſt, which is a full diſcovery of the Miniſtry of God to the Sons of men, which was before held forth in types and ſhadows, but now is given forth in all power in Heaven and earth, by him in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, and whoſe preſence in Spirit and power put an end to all ſhadows, and this being the Subſtance of all that was figured out before, and promiſed before, could not conſiſt in types, ſhadows, and outward waſhings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as theſe diſpenſations that went before did conſiſt in, and that this may appear to be a clear truth, let us conſider times and things as they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118122:12"/> Firſt let us conſider the ſeverall diſpenſation of God to the Sons of men at ſeverall times.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and then let us conſider in this laſt <note place="margin">The Kingdom of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Spirit and power from on high <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 20. 21 <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. not in outward Ceremonies and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Phariſees do imagine.</note> diſpenſation, what is meant by baptiſing all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the name of God, and what the name of God is, into which all Nations are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us obſerve from the clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the word, how the Nations were made partakers of the Commiſſion (which was baptiſing them into the name of God, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Spirit) let us for the proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſider of the clear Teſtimony of the word it ſelf, and not the opinions of men, who do carnally underſtand the great myſtery of God in Spirit and life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then let us obſerve the firſt diſpenſation of God to the ſons of men after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> was generally held forth in the name of the Father, and this in ſeverall types, ſhadows, figures, and Repreſentations of good things to come, and many great and precious promiſes were revealed, but not to be fulfilled unto them, but unto us, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 10. 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond diſpenſation was generally declared, and diſpenſed in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and this was a middle diſpenſation coming between the Law and the Goſpel, and it was more Evangelicall than the Law, and more legall than the Goſpel, and this diſpenſation continued from the coming of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> till Chriſt had finiſhed the work the Father gave him to do in his own perſon here on earth.</p>
            <p>For in this diſpenſation, though <hi>John</hi> pointed out Chriſt more clearly than any before ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh. c.</hi> 1. Chriſt ſpake as never man ſpake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 46. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45. 2. yet very little of the Spirit was poured out, ſo that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves were ignorant of the myſtery of what was declared, and the clear diſcovery of truth was reſerved unto the time of the coming of Chriſt in Spirit in the laſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for Chriſt (as well as <hi>John)</hi> declares the Kingdome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118122:13"/> of heaven to be at hand, not come, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 2. and the word alſo declareth that the Spirit was not given yet, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified, <hi>John</hi> 7. 38. 39.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But now when Chriſt had finiſhed the great work of ſalvation, being riſen from the dead in teſtimony hereof<hi>:</hi> now the time is fulfilled and all is accompliſhed that was to go before, now the time is come that the myſtery of God ſhall wholly be revealed unto the Sons of men in Spirit and power from on high, now there are no more types nor figures to be brought forth by way of command, to ſignifie the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to come, but now the ſubſtance it ſelf is come, which conſiſts in all power in heaven and earth, which needs no ſigns to figure it out, it being preſent.</p>
            <p>And as the former diſpenſations were given out, firſt in the name of the Father, and ſecondly in the name of the Son, ſo this third and laſt, which is to remain, was given forth in the name of Father, Son and Spirit, as the full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the whole myſtery of God unto the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>And it is called Spirit Baptiſme, never ſo called before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to former Generations, nor never ſo named till <hi>John</hi> doth call it ſo, declaring it to come after his Baptiſm,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; now this being the manifeſtation of the Spirit, that is more glorious than all that went before it<hi>:</hi> it hath pleaſed God in his wiſdome to ſtile it the Baptiſm of the Spirit, wherein creatures are made partakers of the name and nature of God, and though believers in all ages did partake of the Baptiſme of the Spirit, yet God hath reſerved the name and title here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto the laſt times, as he hath the greateſt pourings out of Spirit, and that we may not be miſtaken in the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God, opened in the Commiſſion, and ſo with the world and carnall Church underſtand the Baptiſme of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Spirit, to be meant of materiall water. Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the difference between being baptiſed into materiall Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of being baptiſed into the name of God, or Father, Son, and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, it will be good to know and conſider well, what the name of God is, that ſo we may ſee and know what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118122:13"/> we are baptiſed into, when we are baptiſed into the name of God, who is the true, eternall nature or being, declaring himſelf to the ſons of men by ſeverall names and titles, weak creatures, not being able to apprehend God, who is infinite in all whatſoever he is, but through ſuch ſeverall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>
            <p>Firſt then let us conſider, whatſoever name is aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Scripture, it is ſuitable to the nature of God; (as appears clearly)</p>
            <p>Secondly, And let us obſerve this alſo in our following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that as the name of God is ſuitable to himſelf, who is onely good, ſo our name is alſo ſuitable unto our nature, which is corrupt and evil.</p>
            <p>Firſt then the Scripture declares the name of God to be light, and this is the nature of God, God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. here we ſee the name and nature of God is light, it is contrary to the nature of God to have any darkneſſe at all in him.</p>
            <p>And that we may the more clearly ſee into this myſtery of our partaking of the name of God, let us ſee alſo what our own name is of our ſelves, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8. we have our very name and nature deſcribed, <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſſe,</hi> here is our name, and very corrupt nature, even darkneſſe it ſelf; we are filled in our hearts and minds with darkneſſe, yea, thick darkneſſe, ſo that our very name is derived from it.</p>
            <p>And now ſee what a change here is, when we come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the name and nature of God, which is light, then we are called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord hath named according to his promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 2. <hi>now we are light in the Lord,</hi> heere is our name given us of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And herein is our happineſſe to Eternity, that as we are light in the Lord, ſo God is, and will be our light to eternity. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 5. as he hath promiſed,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19. 20. <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſſe ſhall the Moon give light unto thee; for the Lord ſhall be to thee an everlaſting light, &amp; thy God thy glory,</hi> &amp;c. and thus we are baptiſed into the name of God, which is light, the Spirit being as refiners fire in us, burning up and deſtroying our darkneſſe and blindneſſe, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118122:14"/> bringing forth the light of God in us, and tranſlating us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of God in the new Creation, creating light in us, and ſo we are no longer darkneſſe, but light in the Lord, and ſo God changeth our name and nature from darkneſſe to light, and we beholding (in the light of the Lord) the glory of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. are changed into the ſame image or name, or likeneſſe of the Lord, not from any thing of our ſelves, but by the Spirit of the Lord, who is the Spirit of burning and of brightneſſe in us, and thus light is ſown for the righteous, and it ſprings up in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as God is called light, ſo he is called love, <hi>God is love,</hi> 1. John 4. 16. Here is the very name and nature of God meeting in one and the ſame principle, even love; and as we may read the name of God and his nature to be love; ſo alſo we may read our own name in our own nature, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and actions, to be enmity it ſelf, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Ye, who were ſometimes Enemies in your minds, hath he reconciled,</hi> &amp;c. we are of our ſelves in our corrupt nature, Rebellious, and Stubborn againſt God, yea, our minds are ſet on evill works, fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>And we being baptiſed into the name and nature of God, which is all one (love) infinite love; this love of God wrought in us by the operation of the Spirit of love: it is ſo hot and ſtrong in us, that it burns up and deſtroys our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in us in our old nature, and it changeth us into the very love of God, which is his nature, and ſo we come to be partakers of the divine nature, and ſo the new nature or Creation, is brought forth in us, and as we do grow up more, and more in the love of the Father, in the ſame nature; ſo our enmity in our old nature is deſtroyed with the very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature it ſelf, for that which is enmity, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, but muſt be burned up, and quite deſtroyed by the fire of the Spirit, in the Spirit Baptiſme, and thus we may ſee already, there is infinitely more in the Baptiſme of Chriſt, then as we do imagin, when our minds are fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little cold water in a River there below the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the Baptiſme of Chriſt is ſuitable to all power in heaven and in earth, which is onely able to burn up and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118122:14"/> deſtroy our enmity, and bring forth a principle of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love in our ſouls, which all the angels in heaven, and all the men on earth, are never able to do, but onely he who createth all things anew, that are new indeed, and this is not done but by an infinite power, wrought by him that worketh and none can hinder.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the name of God is wiſdome, for Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wiſdome of God,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 8. and Chriſt and the Father are one, and as God is called in Scripture, <hi>The onely wiſe God</hi> Jud. 25. now the name and nature of God is wiſdome, and God is infinite in wiſdome, and it is impoſſible there ſhould be any folly or ignorance in God; but now our name is fooliſh, we are of our ſelves fools, and our very wiſdome is fooliſhneſſe with God, nay our wiſdome is enmity againſt God, and theſe two cannot ſtand together, but the one muſt deſtroy the other, and when we are in the Baptiſme of the Spirit made partakers of the wiſdome of God: then the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit burns up and deſtroys our wiſdome, that is, earthly, fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carnall, and diveliſh, and brings forth a principle of divine wiſdom that is from above, and ſo we come to live and dwell in wiſdom, and wiſdome lives and dwells in us, ſo that we, becauſe wiſe to ſalvation the wiſdome of God is now brought forth in us, and Chriſt is made of God unto us wiſdome, and Chriſt is the wiſdome of the Father, and all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge are hid in him, and Chriſt living in us, the treaſures of divine wiſdome are opened in our ſouls and ſpirits, and we are the children of wiſdome, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is juſtified of her children (though both wiſdome and her children be condemned as fools) and ſo whatſoever crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures think of us, yet the word of Gods eternall wiſdome is our guide, and the true anointing is our teacher, and this is more joy, peace and comfort unto us than all the wiſdome and glory of the world can be unto all that do live in it, and make it their delight and happineſſe for a time, and thus our name is changed from fooliſhneſſe to wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the name of God is purity and holineſſe, <hi>Holy is his name, and he that hath called you is holy, and God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 16.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very nature o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118122:15"/> God is purity it ſelf, God is the Originall of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y and holineſſe<hi>:</hi> but now our Name is quite contrary, and ſo is our Nature, we are all unclean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and impure in our very Name and Nature, we need go no further for proof hereof, than <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and our own experience, if we have any, of the true purity and holineſſe of God in us.</p>
            <p>And when we are made partakers of the Baptiſme of the Spirit, then we are ſpiritually waſhed and cleanſed from our uncleanneſſe, filthineſſe and pollution both of fleſh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; then we are dipt into the pure River of the water of life, that proceeds forth out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb, and as we are waſhed from the guilt of ſin in the blood of the Lamb<hi>:</hi> ſo we are waſhed, rinced and cleanſed from the coruption, power and pollution of ſinne, in the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living water, clear as Chryſtall, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now this is obſervable, that the Baptiſme of the Spirit is compared unto fire and water, both b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus the fire and water of the Spirit meets with the whole body of ſin, and doth by degrees burn it up, deſtroy, conſume, and waſh it away; ſo that in the Baptiſme of the Spirit we come forth in the new Creation, pure, clean and holy, being refined by the true refiner of ſouls, and as Silver is tryed ſeven times in the fire, and as the man was to waſh ſeven times in the Pool; ſo are we purified, and waſhed, and cleanſed from all our filthineſſe, in the pure and precious Baptiſme of the Eternall Spirit, wherein onely we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into the name and nature of God, who is the onely fountain of all purity and holineſſe, and ſo the purity and holineſſe of God is brought forth in our ſouls and Spirits, and thus we partake of his holineſſe; and whoſoever looks unto any other Baptiſme than this, they look below the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118122:15"/> fountain, and ſo looks unto broken ciſterns that can hold none of this pure water, that waſheth and cleanſeth ſouls and Spirits and bodies from their filthineſſe<hi>:</hi> and ſo as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44, 20. <hi>They feed of aſhes, a deceived heart having turned them aſide, ſo that they cannot deliver their own ſouls, nor ſay, is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> or in my beſt affections, or higheſt eſteem?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Again, the name of God is Righteouſneſſe, God is called the Lord our Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and this is alſo the nature of God, the Righteous Lord loveth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. God is the onely Fountain of all righteouſneſſe, and all true Righteouſneſſe proceeds from him alone, as the originall root and Fountain of all Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>But now our own name and nature is quite contrary, as we are in our ſelves, in our nature, principles and actions, our nature that is corrupt ever ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> not by Creation, but by tranſgreſſion, ſo that now our beſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes are no better than filthy rags, as the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6.</p>
            <p>And ſo now, our name is unrighteouſneſſe, ſin, and evill, and this is our nature, as far different from the name and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, as darkneſſe is from light, Sin from Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Evill from Good.</p>
            <p>But now in the Baptiſme of the Spirit, our own name and nature is quite changed, even from Sinne and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, of corrupt fleſh and blood, and we are called by a new name, that the Lord Jehovah doth ſtamp upon us, and bring forth in us. And God doth not onely call us by a new name, ſtamp his name upon us, and record his name in us, but God doth alſo with this name, and in this new name bring forth this new nature in us alſo, and change us from our old name and nature, which is ſin and unrighteouſneſſe it ſelf; and God brings forth his own name and nature in us, which is Righteouſneſſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. The Righteouſneſſe of God is brought forth in us, and we are in the new Creation made the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in Chriſt, who is the eternall word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the true Son of Righteouſneſſe, that doth riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118122:16"/> our ſouls in ſpirit and life. He is that Root and foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain of Divine Righteouſneſſe, into whom we are planted in the Baptiſme of the eternall Spirit; and being planted into the root of righteouſneſſe, our very name and nature is changed, and we take our name, and have our new nature from this pure fountain of eternall righteouſneſſe, <hi>The Lord our Rghteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being thus planted into this pure Fountain, and root of Righteouſneſſe, we ſpring up and grow in righteouſneſſe, and become trees of Righteouſneſſe of the Lords planting, and we have our nouriſhment we (as we may ſay) from the fountain head, being watered every moment with the pure waters of life, that proceeds from the fountain of Life, and all fullneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3.</p>
            <p>And for us to be dipped, waſhed, and rinſed in this River of water, that makes glad the City of our God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 46. 4. and to have this water of life and eternall purity and righteouſnſſe ſprinkled upon our ſpirits, ſouls and bodies, is infinitely more comfort and gladneſſe to us, than to be dipt into or ſprinkled with a little water in our earthly Rivers, that being but a Ceremony, and an outward waſhing at the beſt.</p>
            <p>But ſtill we are to look upon the miniſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpiritually, and ſo to look upon the name of God to be ſuitable to his nature, which is eternall righteouſneſſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as here we have declared: and thus we ſee, that when God doth pour out his ſpirit from on high upon us, then we are changed from our own name and nature, which is unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we are baptiſed into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and Spirit, the onely root, nature and being of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, eternall Righteouſneſſe, and ſo were all righteous, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 6. yea, the righteouſneſſe of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
21.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The name of God is power, the Lord ſtrong and mighty, in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 26. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this alſo, the name and nature of God is one, <hi>The Lord is onely ſtrong and mighty, yea, ſtrength it ſelf, and be alone can work, and none can let him,</hi> Iſa. 40.</p>
            <p>But our name is quite contrary, God hath called us by our names as we are of our ſelves, nothing, vanity, and our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118122:16"/> works nothing, we are compared to the weakeſt things, as <hi>Graſhoppers, a drop of water, a ſmall duſt of a ballance, periſhing creatures, our ſtrength as graſſe the flower of the field,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 40.</p>
            <p>But when we are baptiſed into the name of God, which is power from on high, then our own weakneſſe rules us no longer, but the power of God, who is infinitely ſtronger, that takes place in our ſouls and ſpirits, and the Spirit of God being the Spirit of power, brings forth a principle of divine power in us; the fire of the eternall ſpirit is ſtronger than the oppoſite fire of Luſt, ſtubborneſſe, ſin and rebellion that is in us, and the fire of the ſpirit being unreſiſtable, and an unquenchable fire, it burns up, deſtroys, quencheth and quite puts out the oppoſite fiery ſtrength that it meets with in our ſpirits, which is but weakneſſe it ſelf, in reſpect of the ſtrength of the eternall ſpirit in us.</p>
            <p>And thus in the Baptiſme of the ſpirit which conſiſts in power from on high, we are changed from our own name and nature, which is weakneſſe, nothing, without ſtrength,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the name of God, now we are ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens us (who before could do nothing of our ſelves) and now God hath deſtroyed our weapons, who are carnall and weak, and have pulled down our ſtrong holds of ſin, the world, and Devil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and God hath caſt down our imaginations and ſelf-exaltations againſt God &amp; his appearances in ſpirit; and it is indeed proper onely unto God in ſpirit and power from on high, to throw down all our own power and ſtrength that exalts it ſelf againſt God by his power alone, for no leſſe power can do it, and it is proper alſo unto God, to bring forth a principle of divine power in us, and to indue us with weapons from on high, that ſo we may be able to fight the good fight, and to ſtand in the day of triall, for we can ſtand by no leſſe power, than the power of God<hi>:</hi> and thus we are baptiſed into the Name and Nature of God, which is power from on high.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>The name of God is mercy, pity, compaſſion,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 34. and this is agreeable to the nature of God; it is as naturall to God, to ſhew mercy, pity and compaſſion,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118122:17"/> as it is proper to the Sun to give light: the Scripture doth clearly witneſſe to this truth too, and every ſoul that hath obtained mercy of the Lord, can witneſſe the Lord to be a God full of mercy, pity and compaſſion unto him.</p>
            <p>But now if we look upon our own name, and read it in Scripture, and in our old and corrupt nature, we ſhall find it to be quite contrary to the name of God, for we live <hi>in wrath: Envy, and malice, hatefull and hating one another,</hi> Eph. 2. 2, 3. Tit. 3. 3. our very name is Envy, and Envious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when we come through the mercy of God to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Baptiſme of the Spirit, and are baptiſed into the name and nature of God, which is mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then our envy, wrath, malice and hatred is deſtroyed, and we are made partakers of the name and nature of God, then we are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with mercy, pity and compaſſion.</p>
            <p>And as we were before, envious and hatefull againſt the truth, and all that followed it in ſincerity, proud, lofty, and hard-hearted toward our fellow creatures: now we are quite changed in our hearts, minds and natures<hi>:</hi> now we are kind, mercifull, full of pity and compaſſion toward all men, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do good unto all, even from bowels of mercy and compaſſion within us.</p>
            <p>Now we are humble and lowly in heart, and of a meek and quiet Spirit, ſuitable to the nature of our Father that is in heaven; and thus the Baptiſme of the Spirit brings forth the new nature in us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: and makes us mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull.</p>
            <p>Much more may bee ſaid concerning the Baptiſme of the Spirit, given forth in a Commiſſion by him, who had all power in heaven and earth; but this brief diſcovery of this clear truth, I doubt not, but it is ſufficient to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe that ſee truth in its own light.</p>
            <p>Even thoſe that have the two great witneſſes to witneſſe unto them, and to confirm them in the truth; which is the word written in the Scriptures, and the eternall word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts and minds by the Spirit of the living God; which Spirit is the onely witneſſe within them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the true miniſtry in them, of that word that is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118122:17"/> written in the Scriptures without them. And without this eternall word written in the hidden man of the heart, we are never able to underſtand the myſtery of the word written in the Scriptures, but till we have the witneſſe in our ſelves, we ſhall Antichriſt like carnally underſtand the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And now in concluſion of this point, I deſire all men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider in their own Conſciences which they do think is moſt ſuitable to all power in heaven and earth, to give out a Commiſſion to baptiſe men into the name and nature, and image, and likeneſſe of God, or into materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all water, which was but a figure of good things to come, and a fore-runner of the ſubſtance, as the authour himſelf of it doth clearly teſtifie (as before is witneſſed.)</p>
            <p>But I know, as fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, ſo neither can corrupt and carnall Principles in the heart of man, receive the clear and bright diſcoveries of God in ſpirit, till the principles of Antichriſt the man of ſin and myſtery of iniquity be quite deſtroyed out of the hearts and minds of men, for ſo far as men are carnall, ſo far they will worſhip the Gods of the earth. <hi>And this will be till the God of heaven have famiſhed them all, which will be in his clear and bright coming in ſpirit &amp; power from on high,</hi> Zep.
2. 11. 2 Theſ. 2. 8.</p>
            <p>But now we proceed to the next part of our Diſcourſe, which is to ſhew the teſtimony of the word, how the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons came to be partakers of the Baptiſme of Chriſt, and that it doth appear to be ſpirit-Baptiſme, and anſwers clearly to the Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. wherein it doth clearly appear, that Chriſts Commiſſion to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, was, (as we have before declared) to baptiſe men into the name of God, or Father, Son and Spirit, and not into materiall water, as men do carnally underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Firſt we have a clear teſtimony, in the 11 Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> of the accompliſhing of this great work of Spirit Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, wherein the Commiſſion of Chriſt is fulfilled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the clear teſtimony of the Commiſſion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17, 18. 1. Here is <hi>Peters</hi> preaching the Goſpel according to his Commiſſion he had received of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118122:18"/> 2. Here is the ſpirit falling on the People as Chriſt had promiſed, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſhall be baptiſed with the holy ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Here is <hi>Peters</hi> remembring the words of the Lord, with his Teſtimony what it was;
<hi>That</hi> John <hi>baptiſed with water, but they ſhould be baptiſed with the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Upon this great work of the ſpirit wrought on the people, here is <hi>Peters</hi> Apology, that ſeeing God had in his miniſtry baptiſed the Gentiles with the Baptiſme of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as they were at the beginning, that he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God.</p>
            <p>5. Here is the Teſtimony of thoſe brethren that came with <hi>Peter,</hi> who were eye-witneſſes of this great work of God upon the Gentiles, <hi>Then they held their peace, and glorified God ſaying, then hath God alſo unto the Gentiles granted Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now carnall reaſon and ignorance will object againſt the Baptiſme of the Eternall ſpirit in this place, and it will be this, that the Baptiſme of the ſpirit is here meant onely of the Baptiſme of gifts, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>But though I intend to anſwer all objections that are againſt this clear truth, (that I do at preſent know of) in my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, yet I muſt here anſwer thus, for I am not to ſeek of this, how men that ſtand upon carnall, and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and traditionall obſervations of the things of God, how they will object againſt the clear truth to uphold their own carnall principles, ends, and intereſts, but the truth will manifeſt it ſelf to their ſhame, that ſo oppoſe it. And for anſwer to this Objection, I deſire to go no further than the clear Teſtimony of the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this Objection, let us obſerve the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the 14. and 18 verſes of this 11 Chapter. In v<hi>:</hi> 14. we have recorded, that the words, <hi>Peter</hi> was to ſpeak, ſhould be inſtrumentall, for the ſaving of the man and all his houſe.</p>
            <p>Now there was more in the words of ſalvatio than the Baptiſme of Gifts, as men do imagine; for in the words of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, there was the great myſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of God opened unto weak creatures; and theſe words were ſo effectuall, through the opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of the eternall ſpirit, that they were effectuall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118122:18"/> for the ſaving the man and his whole houſe from ſinne and all unrighteouſneſſe, and for the turning the man and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from darkneſſe to light, from ſin to God, for opening their blind eyes, and waſhing them in the bloud of the Lamb, and pouring forth the pure waters of life upon their ſouls, waſhing and cleanſing them from all unrighteouſneſſe, ſin and filthineſſe, and bringing forth in them the pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature of God, in their hearts, ſouls and ſpirits, this and all elſe whatſoever is included in ſalvation, is here by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles miniſtry made effectuall in them, according to the Commiſſion, which was to baptiſe them into the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit; and this is the ſubſtance of Spirit-Baptiſme, and is infinitely more than is imagined by thoſe, who think the Baptiſme of the ſpirit to conſiſt barely in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gifts, as they ſay, given in an inviſible manner, or how they pleaſe to wreſt the Teſtimony of Spirit Baptiſme to maintain their own ends, opinions and carnall conceits, for the ſetting up of ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (But may not Gods whole work in his people be called a gift, or gifts?) and in <hi>v.</hi> 18. It is recorded that thoſe believing Jews that came with <hi>Peter,</hi> when they ſaw the great work of God wrought upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that then they held their peace, and glorified God ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then hath God alſo unto the Gentiles granted Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life. They did not lay the Subſtance of the great effect of <hi>Peters</hi> miniſtry upon the receiving of viſible gifts, but that God had granted unto them repentance unto life, in which, as we ſaid before, is contained the whole work of ſalvation wrought in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And here let us obſerve, 1. Chriſts Commiſſion, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptiſing them into the name of the Father, Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts promiſe, <hi>Ye ſhall be baptiſed with the Spirit,</hi> Acts 1. 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Peters</hi> obeying the Commiſſion, in preaching the Goſpel unto the Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The promiſe following, they are baptiſed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and <hi>Peter</hi> here remembers the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here is the ſubſtance of Chriſts Baptiſme declared,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118122:19"/> which was the effect of <hi>Peters</hi> preaching: even ſalvation and Repentance unto life. Here is clear teſtimony enough, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe that look upon truth ſingly in it ſelf, and that are not baptiſed with Traditions, Forms, and Opinions of men.</p>
            <p>So here we have one clear Teſtimony from the word it ſelf, of the fulfilling the great Ordinance of Spirit-Baptiſme, ordained and given forth by him, who had all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in earth, and fulfilled by the ſame power from on high, which was preſent in the Apoſtles Miniſtry according to his promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. for the accompliſhing this great work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we have another clear Teſtimony of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the great work of Spirit-Baptiſme upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. In the beginning of the Chapter, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwers a common Objection that men bring againſt the free Grace of God ſhed abroad in his peoples hearts; <hi>Shall we ſin that grace may abound?</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>God forbid;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he reaſons out the point, ſaying, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>v.</hi> 3. He ſhews how we came to be dead to ſin, it was by being baptiſed into the death of Chriſt, and <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>We are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by this Baptiſme into death,</hi> but what death? death to ſinne; we are now dead to ſin (I hope no man is ſo ſimple as to think that baptiſing men into materiall water can kill ſin in them, or make them dead unto ſin.)</p>
            <p>And <hi>v.</hi> 5. We have the Apoſtle declaring the buſineſſe ſo plain, that he that can ſee, though but dimly, yet he may ſee what the Apoſtles meaning is, for (ſaith he)
<hi>If we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his Reſurrection.</hi> Here the Apoſtle calls this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme planting into Chriſts death; and is materiall water think you of any force at all, to plant us into the death of Chriſt? Let thoſe who are truly partakers of the power of Chriſts deathin their own ſouls, which deſtroy the life and power of ſinne in themſelves, let ſuch I ſay come forth, and witneſſe to this truth, whether ſin be deſtroyed in them by being baptiſed into the power and vertue of Chriſts death, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118122:19"/> whether ſin be deſtroyed in them by any outward waſhing.</p>
            <p>And again, v. 6. this is a thing known to believers, that our old man is crucified with Chriſt, and it is for this end, that the whole body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that ſo we ſhould ſerve ſin no longer.</p>
            <p>Let us once more briefly conſider of the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here.</p>
            <p>V. 3. Thoſe that were baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptiſed into his death; therefore not into materiall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the death of Chriſt with the power and vertue thereof, is not, nor cannot be materiall water; therefore the Baptiſme here ſpoken of, cannot be meant of materiall water.</p>
            <p>V. 4. We are buried with him by Baptiſme into death, therefore not into materiall water; for death and water is not one, but by vertue of our being baptiſed into death with Chriſt, ſo as Chriſt was raiſed by the glory of the Father, ſo we ſhould walk in newneſſe of life, by vertue of our partaking of the power of Chriſts death, and reſurrection in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Baptiſme, which conſiſts in power from on high.</p>
            <p>V. 5. The Apoſtle concludes it muſt ſo follow, for if we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likenes of his Reſurrection<hi>:</hi> and here let us obſerve, what he before called baptiſing into Chriſt, baptiſing into his death, buried with him into death by Baptiſme: now he calls planting together in the likeneſſe of his death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall water cannot plant us into the likeneſſe of Chriſts death, which is in effect the deſtroying of ſin<hi>:</hi> therefore the Baptiſme here cannot be materiall water, but it is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Spirit, which onely is able to deſtroy ſin and all evill in us, and to bring forth the image and likeneſſe of Chriſt, in us, in our new birth, and ſo we ſee the Commiſſion was fulfilled in changing people from their own name and likeneſſe, and to bring forth the name and likeneſſe of God in them.</p>
            <p>3. Again we have another Teſtimony of the great effect of Spirit Baptiſme upon the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. the Apoſtle reckons up ſeverall works of the fleſh that raigns in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118122:20"/> thoſe that ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God, <hi>v.</hi> 11. he tells them that <hi>ſome of them were ſuch;</hi> and he alſo tells them how they came to be changed, <hi>but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>

            <p>Here was the work of all power in heaven ad earth, wrought upon poor ſinfull ſouls, that were full of all abominations and all filthineſſe of fleſh and Spirit, and this was done, by waſhing, ſanctifying, and juſtifying in the name of him, who had all power in heaven and earth given unto him for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work, that ſouls might be waſhed, cleanſed, ſanctified purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and juſtified, and here is the ſpirits work alſo in this great and mighty change wrought in thoſe Corinthians, in the name of the Lord Jeſus and in the ſpirit of our God.</p>
            <p>Here is a Teſtimony of the coming forth of the word &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of eternal being, even from the boſome of eternall love and kindneſſe, pity and compaſſion, for the eternall God of poor, wretched, ſinfull creatures<hi>:</hi> and here the word and ſpirit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal being, coming forth in power from on high, is implyed about this great work of wonder, in waſhing, cleanſing, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, ſanctifying and juſtifying poor undone ſouls, that ly wallowing in their own blood and filthineſſe.</p>
            <p>What think ye, O ye that have any love to the truth? Here you may ſee a waſhing, but not with material water, but a waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the pure river of water of life, clear as Cryſtall coming forth from the Fountain of all life and ſweetneſſe, and this water is onely able to waſh, cleanſe and ſanctifie ſouls and ſpirits from all ſin and filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>We can aſcribe nothing at all unto materiall water, in this great work of waſhing, cleanſing ſanctifying and juſtifying of ſouls in the preſence of the infinitely righteous, pure and holy God, but we do aſcribe the whole work hereof unto the mighty God, in the Baptiſm of the eternall Spirit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts onely in power from on high, in ſpirituall waſhing in the pure river of living water, which continues in us a well of water ſpringing up unto eternall life; and I could wiſh with my whole heart, that thoſe, who profeſſe to know God, would not undervalue the Baptiſm of the eternall Spirit, and ſet us a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118122:20"/> poore and beggerly element in the room of ſo glorious a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that conſiſts in all power in heaven and earth, but now we proceed to the next Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the next teſtimony of creatures being baptiſed into Chriſt, is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
27. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptiſed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> The baptiſers of our times, as they ſay they are, do quite croſſe the witneſſe of the word here; for the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>that as many of them as had been baptiſed into Chriſt, had put on Chriſt:</hi> but they ſay, none muſt put on Chriſt, (that is) profeſſe Chriſt firſt, and be baptiſed in materiall water afterward<hi>:</hi> but the Apoſtle ſaith no ſuch thing here, though this were the practiſe of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, and uſed afterward, as we ſhall ſhew more hereafter, when we come to anſwer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; but to obſerve a little from the words.</p>
            <p>1. The word ſaith, they were baptiſed into Chriſt, therefore not into water. 2. As many as were baptiſed into Chriſt, had put on Chriſt, but all that were baptiſed in material water had not put on Chriſt; no not in thoſe very times, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for example,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now we ſhall obſerve, what it is to be baptiſed into Chriſt, and what it is to put on Chriſt; which is the effect of being baptiſed into Chriſt, thoſe that are baptiſed into Chriſt, are baptiſed into the power of Chriſts death and Reſurrection, and ſo our ſin &amp; evill is deſtroyed by the preſence of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſts death in us, and a new life is brought forth in us, by vertue of Chriſt living in us. And Chriſt living in us, is in all his divine appearances, in Spirit and life Chriſt: living in us, in the glory of the Father, brings forth in us a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of divine love, light, wiſdome, power, righteouſneſſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, purity, truth, faithfulneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus (as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before) we are baptiſed into all the divine appearances of Chriſt in Spirit; and ſo by vertue of being baptiſed into Chriſt in all his goodneſſe, being that fountain of fullneſſe of divine treaſures, in whom God will make creatures partakers of his own name &amp; nature, I ſay, by vertue of being thus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into Chriſt, we do really put on Chriſt in his manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in light and love, by vertue of being baptiſed into Chriſt, we do really put on Chriſt in his manifeſtations in light and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118122:21"/> love<hi>:</hi> by vertue of being baptiſed into Chriſt, we walk in the light of Chriſt, and thus we ſhine forth in the light of God among a crooked &amp; perverſe people, among whom we do live, and likewiſe we do live in the love of Chriſt, &amp; this love doth appear unto all men, &amp; thus we fulfill the Law of Chriſt to do, as we would be done unto, and ſo living in the love of Chriſt, a principle of divine love is brought forth in us, and from this love within us, we walk in love unto all, and are filled with Kindneſſe, Pity, Bowels of Compaſſion, Humbleneſſe of Mind, meekneſſe of Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto all our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt being the true way into the poſſeſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all the goodneſſe of the eternall God; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptiſed into Chriſt, we are partakers of the true and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, in the true way the Father hath opened for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to poſſeſſe his love and goodneſſe in unto eternity, and in this Baptiſme we are taken up into God, and ſo we live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the wayes of this world in Chriſt, and in him in the Father, in ſpirit, the onely true way into all happineſſe, and the onely happineſſe to eternity, and Chriſt is alſo the truth, and we being baptiſed into Chriſt are made partakers of the truth, as it is in Jeſus; (but thoſe, who are baptiſed in materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all water, may ſtill live in error, for all this) but thoſe who, are baptiſed into Chriſt, who is the truth, they live in the truth, walk in the truth, act in the truth, and ſpeak truth; yea, they that put on Chriſt in truth, and are clothed with truth, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, holineſſe, purity, ſyncerity, <hi>&amp;c. as with a Garment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo as Chriſt is, ſo are they in this world, and ſo every one that is baptiſed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, and ſo do appear in the likeneſſe of Chriſt, in the new Creation, the work of God alone, in ſpirit and power from on high.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We have another clear teſtimony of the Baptiſme of the ſpirit, the onely true ſpirituall waſhing, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. and how it is wrought according to the Commiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. the words are theſe, <hi>Husbands love your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a clear teſtimony of the accompliſhing the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118122:21"/> of Chriſt upon thoſe people that belonged to his church. 1. Here is Chriſts love to his Church. 2. Here is the effect of his love; he gave himſelf for his Church. And 3. Here is the end, why he gave himſelf for his Church or people? and that is, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it. 4. Here is the means whereby this is done; it is with the waſhing of water by the word.</p>
            <p>And now the end of all is, that it might be preſented unto himſelf, a glorious Church, without ſpot or wrinckle, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing like ſpot or wrinckle, but holy and without blame.</p>
            <p>And now that this great work of waſhing, ſanictfying, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and purifying the Church of Chriſt may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the end of his redeeming it<hi>:</hi> now he was riſen, and had finiſhed the great work of redeeming his Church, now all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his Church.</p>
            <p>And now Chriſt having received all power in heaven and earth for the accompliſhing this great work of ſanctifying and cleanſing his Church, that this may be done, he gives his Apoſtles a Commiſſion to <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> and in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
<hi>Baptiſe them into name of Father, Son, and Spirit,</hi> and ſo as inſtruments, ſprinkle the name of God upon them, and dip them into the pure river of water of life, which is onely able to ſanctifie and cleanſe them, that ſo they might be holy and without blame in the preſence of God, and of the Lamb, who is undefiled.</p>
            <p>Now this is the means, whereby Chriſt ſanctifieth and cleanſeth his Church, with the waſhing of water by the word; now the word being the miniſtration of the eternall Spirit, and given forth in all power in heaven and earth, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to weak creatures.</p>
            <p>Yet the word they preached, being the miniſtration of the Spirit, and all power in heaven and earth, being preſent in their miniſtry, they are made inſtruments in the hand of God, for the accompliſhing this great work of ſanctifying and cleanſing ſouls, with the waſhing of living water by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word of life.</p>
            <p>This was that adminiſtration that God had declared by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118122:22"/> the Prophets long before, that ſhould be accompliſhed in the latter dayes, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>In the Wilderneſſe ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the Deſart, v.</hi> 7. <hi>And the parched ground ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a pool, and the thirſty land ſprings of water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And chap.</hi> 41. 18. <hi>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middeſt of the vallies: I will make the wilderneſſe a pool of water, and the dry land ſprings of water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and chap.</hi> 44. 3. <hi>For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and flouds upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy Offſpring,</hi> See alſo Ezek. 16. 8, 9. and chap. 36. 25, 26. and cap. 47. with Joel 2. and ſeverall other places, that God did declare by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that ſhould be fulfilled unto us in Goſpel-times (which is the miniſtration of the Spirit) as ſaith the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the way that the onely wiſe God is pleaſed to pour out the fountain of living waters, upon his people in theſe latter dayes, even in the miniſtry of the word; this is the way God will ſanctifie, waſh and cleanſe his people, with the waſhing of water by the word.</p>
            <p>Now this diſpenſation of God being mighty, it brings forth mighty effects in the world upon the Sons of men; for the power of God, being preſent in this Goſpel miniſtry, it makes his people willing in this day of his power, it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through God to throw down the ſtrong holds of ſin, to turn men from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of the Devill to God.</p>
            <p>In this Miniſtry God doth by his mighty power bring forth the new nature in his people, and makes all things new in them; and God in this miniſtry enters into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Covenant with his people to be their God for ever, and they to be his people to Eternity.</p>
            <p>In this miniſtry of the word through the operation of the eternall ſpirit, God brings forth a principle of power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him alone, and truſt in him alone, and God doth by this miniſtry take off his people from all dependence upon creatures, and creature-excellency, and ſets them upon the rock of ages, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength,</p>
            <p>In this miniſtry God doth enter into an evelaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118122:22"/> with his people, and give them a new heart, and Spirit according to his promiſe, and pour clean water upon them, and make them clean, and waſh them from all their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and this is the onely water of the Goſpel, and the onely waſhing of the new Teſtament, but Goſpel-waſhing, is an outward, and carnall, or legall waſhing, as carnall creatures do imagine.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee the miniſtry of the Spirit in Goſpel-times is ſet forth by a ſpirituall water-waſhing, cleanſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the miniſtry of the ſpirit, is a ſpirituall waſhing of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall water by the word, as we have clear Teſtimony from the word written in the Scriptures, ſuitable to the word written in the hidden man of the heart, the work of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. See <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt: but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of living water, ſpringing up into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> &amp;c. Here Chriſt takes the woman off from all carnal and outward obſervations of the ſpirituall waters of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Kingdome, and ſets her a looking after the true wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, that flows out from the Fountain of life.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God:</hi> But materiall water hath no place in bringing forth a new birth; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit;</hi> but it is unpoſſible mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riall water can bring forth any part of the new birth, but if they were old creatures, before, and dipped or ſprinckled with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, they are ſo ſtill. It is onely the Heavenly water that hath force to waſh away ſin, and to bring forth the new birth in us, as thoſe can witneſſe that have this heavenly birth brought forth in them, and are waſhed with pure water of Life.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We have another Teſtimony of the Baptiſme of Chriſt in the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, that they were made partakers of the Baptiſme of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Col. 2. 12. in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. The Apoſtle bids them beware of Philoſophy, vain deceits, the traditions of men; the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Elements of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is not water-Baptiſme
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118122:23"/> an Element of this world among the reſt: as a tradition or carnall Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we may ſee <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. V. 9. The Apoſtle ſets forth Chriſt to be the onely ſubſtance that we ought to look after; <hi>For in him dwelleth all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Godhead bodily,</hi> and all fullneſſe being in him, ſee in the next place what doth follow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ye are compleat in him, which is the head of all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, our compleatneſſe conſiſts in Chriſts being in us, and our being in him, and no part of our compleatneſſe can conſiſt in any of the Elements of this world, therefore not in being thrown into the Element of water.</p>
            <p n="4">4. V. 11. He takes them off from that ancient and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ceremony of Circumciſion in the fleſh, and ſets them a looking into the Subſtance, which was the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made without hands, and this was the putting off the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinnes of the fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, which is ſpirituall, for nothing but Spirit can deſtroy Fleſh.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Having now ſet forth the true Circumciſion, which is truly ſpirituall, he comes now to ſet forth the true and ſubſtantiall Baptiſme, which alſo is truly ſpirituall,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>buried with him in Baptiſme, wherein alſo ye are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now we are not onely buried with Chriſt in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but in this Baptiſme we are alſo riſen with Chriſt (wherein alſo ye are riſen with Chriſt) but wee may be buried under earthly water, and yet never riſen with Chriſt<hi>:</hi> therefore this cannot be the Baptiſme here ſpoken of, but in the following words we have the power of God ſet forth by which this is done, even the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed Chriſt from the dead, <hi>He that hath raiſed Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is ſtill relation to the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Now we know, that after Chriſt was riſen from the dead,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118122:23"/> then all power in heaven and in earth, was given unto him of God the Father, for the gathering in of his Church that he had redeemed out of every Kingdome, People and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was the effect of the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat</hi> 28. <hi>Baptiſing them into the name of Father, Son and Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here as the Apoſtle takes off the Coloſſions from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Circumciſion in the fleſh<hi>:</hi> ſo he alſo takes them off from looking after the Baptiſme of water, that was but fleſhly, or in outward waſhing.</p>
            <p>And as he takes them off from all types and outward reſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blances, which were in uſe before the ſubſtance came; ſo no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he ſets forth the ſubſtance, which is the Baptiſme of the Spirit, by which they were baptiſed into Chriſt, and ſo made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the power and vertue of Chriſts death, and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in which Baptiſm they were made partakers of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lneſſe of God. and ſo were compleat in Chriſt, who is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image and glory of the Father.</p>
            <p>And thus we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſme, and By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hereof we are raiſed from a dead ſtate of ſin and evill, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new life, by being baptiſed into the power of Chriſts death and reſurrection, and the power and vertue hereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating in our ſouls and ſpirits, changeth and transforms us into the image and likeneſſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo the new nature is brought forth in us, and we are born from above, of water and the Spirit, not of fleſh and bloud, nor of fleſhly forms, as the world and carnall Church is; for it is nothing, but Spirit, and ſpirituall waters that can bring forth the ſpirituall birth in us, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> and nothing but the Spirit Baptiſme can baptiſe us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and his fullneſſe, for water-baptiſme cannot make us partakers of his fullneſſe, we can onely have unity in a form in this, but not unity in the fullneſſe of Chriſt, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O that we could in this clear diſcovery of the eternall God, behold his Teſtimony in this place in the clear light, and wiſdome of the eternall Spirit, for then we ſhould not look ſo low as we do, upon earthly, and carnall obſervations of the things of God, and eſpecially of the Baptiſme of the eternall Spirit, the onely Baptiſme of the new Teſtament, but then we ſhould look upon it, as it is the work of all power in heaven and earth, according to its firſt inſtitution, and then we ſhould ſee the glorious effects of it fulfilled in the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then we ſhould ſee the new birth brought forth in ſouls, by this ſpirituall waſhing, the work of God alone, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and renewing of his Spirit, or wrought by his ſpirit in us.</p>

            <p>Here is the work of all power in heaven and earth, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls by ſpirituall waſhing, and this onely is ſuitable to the Commiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. ſpirituall waſhing or bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing; in which we are made partakers of the name &amp; nature of God, being by the preſence of the eternal Spirit in us waſhed, renewed, regenerated, ſanctified and cleanſed from our own filthineſſe, ſin, and pollution, which is contrary to God, and all appearances of God in Spirit.</p>
            <p>Here is the great Goſpel-work of ſaving creatures from their ſin and all iniquity, by the love, kindneſſe and mercy of the Lord Jehovah<hi>:</hi> and here is the way alſo ſet forth in which the Lord Jehovah ſaveth ſouls from ſin<hi>:</hi> it is by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall waſhing, and ſpirituall renewing of them, by the work of the eternall ſpirit; and O that we were more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the glorious work of all power in heaven and earth manifeſted in us, in waſhing and cleanſing us from all ſin and uncleanneſſe, and bringing forth the pure and divine nature in us, which work is of the Lord alone, and not of man, who is as nothing, and vanity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Baptiſm or waſhing of the New Teſtament, is not like
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118122:25"/> thoſe carnall, legal, figurative, and typicall waſhings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were adminiſtred either by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> in which the ſubſtance of the great things to come, were figured out, or declared to come after.</p>
            <p>But the ſubſtance it ſelf goeth forth in the Baptiſme or waſhing of the New Teſtament, this waſhing is to purpoſe, for in it, and by it, we are waſhed and ſaved from our ſin, and this is the ſubſtantiall and onely waſhing of all waſhings.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, we have another clear Teſtimony of the true and ſpirituall waſhing, the onely Baptiſme of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Pet. chapter</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. the words are theſe; <hi>The like figure</hi> (or example) <hi>whereunto Baptiſme doth alſo now ſave us,</hi> (not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience toward God) <hi>by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we have the true Baptiſme of the New Teſtament ſet forth, and the people taken off from all outward waſhings, (not the waſhing of water)</p>
            <p>1. Here the Apoſtle declares the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the Ark, from drowning by water, <hi>v.</hi> 20. and now he tells them of another kind of ſaving, and this is by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (of which that was a ſigne or example) or this is an example of that,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Baptiſme doth now ſave us, but is it water-Baptiſme that doth ſave us now? no ſaith he, not the waſhing of the filth of the fleſh; what then? why the anſwer of a good conſcience; but whereby is the anſwer of a good conſcience brought forth, not by water-Baptiſme, but by the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Here is a clear alluſion to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and to the power and vertue thereof; for then Chriſt received all power in heaven and earth, for the accompliſhing this great work of ſpirituall Baptiſm or waſhing, and ſo the power, and vertue hereof doth baptiſe ſouls into the goodneſſe of God, cleanſe and purifie their Conſciences, and ſo the anſwer of a good Conſcience is brought forth in them by vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection, by virtue whereof ſoules are waſhed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118122:25"/> and cleanſed from an evill and corrupt Conſcience, whereby all men are naturally defiled by ſin and evill.</p>
            <p>The like teſtimony of ſpiritual Baptiſme or Waſhing, we have declared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
22. in <hi>v.</hi> 20. the Apoſtle deſcribes a new and living way, by whom we do enter into the holieſt place, even the preſence of the infinitely holy God; and in this 22. <hi>v.</hi> he declares how it is that we doe draw neer unto God in this new and living way<hi>:</hi> it is by having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</p>
            <p>So here we ſee how the anſwer of a good Conſcience is brought forth<hi>:</hi> it is by being ſprinkled with pure water (but our earthly waters will not, nor cannot bring forth ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in us, it is onely the waters of the Spirit that can doe this<hi>:</hi> that river of pure water of life that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 1. and this is the onely water that waſheth, ſprinkleth and clenſeth hearts, ſpirits, ſouls, conſciences, and bodies, from all evill, ſinne, filthineſſe and uncleaneneſſe of the whole man.</p>
            <p>Thus I have faithfully declared the true Goſpell baptiſme, as I have received from the Lord, agreeable to the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures, and alſo the eternall Word written in the hidden man of the heart, the two great Witneſſes of God in the World.</p>
            <p>And now I know this clear truth of God revealed in the clear light and wiſdome of the Eternal Spirit, will not with many oppoſers (as it hath already) throw mens carnal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Baptiſm of the New Teſtament. I ſhall therefore fairly Anſwer all Objections that are againſt this clear Truth: according to the Teſtimony of the pure and clear Word of Truth. Even as many as I do at preſent know and have heard of.</p>
            <p>And though there may be many more then I have heard of, yet though I cannot anſwer all, or if I could not anſwer any, yet I know the truth is able to anſwer all oppoſers againſt it.</p>
            <p>Now it remains that we anſwer the Objections which are for water Baptiſme; and they are not a few<hi>:</hi> but for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118122:26"/> to thoſe that deſires to be ſatisfied with truth alone<hi>:</hi> I ſhall lay down the Objections that are for water Baptiſme<hi>:</hi> and the ſeverall exceptions againſt them, in anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections for water Baptiſme<hi>:</hi> that ſo they all may judge of it, who are not biaſſed with any forms or opinions, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men whatſoever, but deſires to look upon truth in its own light<hi>:</hi> for thoſe who are fixed upon the forms and traditions of the former ages, ſet up in the old building of Antichriſt in his Kingdom; they ſtand for their forms, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and outward waſhings, and carnal obſervations, as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as the old Scribes and Phariſees did; yea, though they do oppoſe
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf in Spirit and Power from on high<hi>:</hi> and tell him to his face (in the Teſtimony of his Word. and Spirit) that he is a deceiver and ſeducer of the People, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they never look upon their making void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God by their Traditions, as Chriſt told their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
            <p>Seeing there are ſo many Objections againſt Spirit Baptiſm, and for to maintain Water Baptiſme: I care not much where I begin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt then it will be objected, that Water Baptiſm came in the room of Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As if one Type did come in the room of another, even then, when the ſubſtance was come, and all Types were at an end; Beſides, where is your ground from the clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Word, that Water Baptiſme came in the room of Circumciſion? but ſeeing there is no ground from the Word to prove this Objection, I have no ground to believe it, for I am not to believe the opinions of men, but the Word of Truth; and where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Water Baptiſme is a Signe or Seale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as Circumciſion was a Seal unto the People of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the word, ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> That Circumciſion was made with hands; and it was but in the fleſh, not in the Spirit, in the outward man, not in the inward and hidden man of the heart, and when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was come, the Apoſtle declares againſt this circumciſion, and cals it no circumciſion, ſaying, for he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion, which is outward
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118122:26"/> in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh<hi>:</hi> but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is that of the heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, <hi>Whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God,</hi> Romanes 2. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>And here I have good ground by this Rule, to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt water-Baptiſm, and ſay, that is not Baptiſm that is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the fleſh, or fleſhly waſhing, but that is true Baptiſme that is in the heart and ſpirit and inward man, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God,</hi> but Phariſaicall Jews muſt have ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward waſhing, or elſe he ſhall be a deceiver, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>2. All things under the Law, were generally confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, by outward ſeals, ſigns, figures and outward Repreſentations, Heb. 9. 10. but the Goſpel is not declared nor confirmed by outward Teſtimonies unto thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but by inward and ſpirituall witneſſes and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the heart and inward man, but the Jews muſt have ſome outward ſigne like their outward Religion.</p>
            <p>3. Where do you find in Scripture, that water-Baptiſme hath that honour given unto it, to be a ſeal of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or any part of it? either of faith, love, righteouſneſſe,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know no outward fleſhly, and carnall Seal, to confirm an inward ſpiritual and everlaſting Covenant unto believers, but formall believers muſt have formall Seals, or elſe they will not believe truth, but the Seal of the Covenant that God makes with his people in all Goſpel-times, is the Spirit of promiſe, whom the Lord hath promiſed to give unto all that he makes poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſors of the New Covenant, in whom that after ye believed ye were ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.
13.</p>
            <p>This is the true Seal of all believers, that ſeals and confirms all the goodneſſe of God unto them in the great Covenant of free grace and mercy unto them, and other Seals I know none, nor I cannot own any other, except the word did declare it, but it is the Spirit, that is the onely Seal of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the earneſt of our eternall poſſeſſion, that we have in and through Chriſt, being freely given unto us.</p>
            <p>4. Where do you find in the word, that the teſtimony of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118122:27"/> Spirit in our hearts, written by the finger of God, that we are commanded to ſet up a Signe or Seal in the Fleſh, to confirm it to us, or declare it to others.</p>
            <p>Would this be Goſpel think you, or any part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? is this any of the worſhip of God in Spirit? or any part of the Goſpel, which is wholly ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>5. Where do you find that the love of God ſhed abroad in his peoples hearts, (that fills them with zeal for the glory of God) as hot as fire, that this hath need of a litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cool wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to confirm it unto them, or to be a Seal unto them of this love in them, or would you have it a Seal unto nothing? or to a blank, as it is unto your Infants that are ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckled.</p>
            <p>6. Muſt the Baptiſme of the eternall Spirit wrought in our hearts, ſouls and Spirits, by all power in heaven and earth, the very life and ſubſtance of Goſpel-grace in us wrought, muſt this have an empty ſhadow follow after it, to be a ſign or Seal, to ſignifie what the Subſtance was that went before? how can any creature call this Goſpel?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ob.</hi> Water Baptiſme diſtinguiſheth the Church from the world,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1. As if the righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, purity, love, ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, meekneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, pity, compaſſion, bowels of mercy, gentleneſſe, long ſuffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which is brought forth by the mighty power of God in the new man in the new Creation, as if ſuch, who are the Church of Chriſt, &amp; members in particular, had need of ſome outward waſhing, to ſhew forth to all men that they are waſhed within, or that theſe ſo qualified had any need to have any outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to diſtinguiſh them from the world; their principles and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are oppoſite to the world; therefore clearly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from them.</p>
            <p>2. Is not the Law of God written in his peoples hearts, able to diſcern them from the world? ſeeing Gods Laws are pure, holy, juſt, good, righteous, and upright Laws, that are written in his peoples hearts, and brought forth in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what think you? are not ſuch Laws, who are of God, the Laws of the ſpirit of life, of love, of power, and of a ſound
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118122:27"/> mind, are not theſe ſufficient to diſtinguiſh Gods people from the world, the world being led by the Devil and their own luſts.</p>
            <p>3. What think you, is not the light of God in his people, clear enough, &amp; bright enough, ſhining forth in them and they in it, to diſtinguiſh them from the blind and dark world, who do live and walk in darkneſſe, and ſtumble at they know not what, ſeeing light is ſown for the righteous, and it ſprings up in them, and they ſhine forth in it. I hope this will be bright enough to ſee and diſcern them in, without their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under water.</p>
            <p>4. The wiſdome of God being wrought in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the word of Gods eternall wiſdome, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, this is wiſe enough to diſtinguiſh them from the ignorant and fooliſh world: this is wiſe enough to direct them in wayes above the wayes of the world, and ſo the wiſdome of God being revealed in the ſecret parts, in the inward man, and ſo teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole man to walk wiſely toward all men, that ſo wiſdome might be juſtified of her children, and this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſtinguiſh wiſdomes children from the world, they need not have water-Baptiſme to help in this buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>5. Is not the love of God revealed in his people, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their happineſſe, and that whereby they do ſtand<hi>:</hi> is not this enough to diſtinguiſh them from the world, who lives in wrath, hatred, malice, and envy, hatefull, and hating one another.</p>
            <p>6. Is not the holineſſe, purity and righteouſneſſe of God holy enough, and pure enough, and righteous enough being brought forth by the mighty power of God in them; for to diſtingiſh them from the unclean, unholy, and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous world, except they be waſhed in earthly water? what think you? can this adde any thing to the purity, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe of God, for the further diſtinguiſhing of us from the profane world?</p>
            <p>7. The grace of God, that bringeth eternall ſalvation to light in our ſouls; teacheth us to deny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and teacheth us alſo to live Godly, Righteouſly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118122:28"/> and ſoberly in this preſent world: and is not this enough to diſtinguiſh us from the evil world? O that we could once ſee that principle of eternall grace manifeſt it ſelf in thoſe that profeſſe godlineſſe, then I affirm, they need no more to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the world.</p>
            <p>8. God dwells in his people, walks in them, lives in them, they are his habitation, his reſting place, they live in God in divine injoyments, and what think you now? is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, living and dwelling in his people, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſcoveries, and injoyments, of love and favour, living in them to Eternity? Is this enough to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the world, who do live without God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What think you? is not eternall being the Lord Jehovah, the mighty God, in the love, wiſdome, life, light, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of divine ſpirituall glory, enough to diſtinguiſh his people from the world, without their coming under ſome carnall ordinance, of being thrown into water or the like.</p>
            <p>9. You talk of diſtinguiſhing the world and carnall Church one from another by water-Baptiſme, but you are quite out, for this is rather a mark of Antichriſt, wherein the world and carnall Church are joyned together, and ſo a Kingdome of Antichriſt, is made up of carnall Chriſtians, made ſo by water-Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 4. But Infant-Baptiſme, hath been of a long time ſtanding, for ought we know even from the Apoſtles times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let this be granted, yet, if you cannot make it appear to be of Scripture proof, either from command or example, it is nothing worth, for conſider, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Antichriſts gone forth, even in the Apoſtles times, and that which hath no ground in Scripture muſt needs be an Antichriſt, and then here is the whole line of your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion cut off.</p>
            <p>What do you think?</p>
            <p>Is not this the way to ſet up an Antichriſt, to go about to make Chriſtians, where Chriſt makes none? Now all <hi>Europe,</hi> have been made Chriſtians by Infant-Baptiſme<hi>:</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118122:28"/> yet many thouſands of them have not been Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and then, what have they been but Antichriſtians, and all this hath been done, without any Teſtimony at all from the word, therefore it is of Antichriſt, and not of the true Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Again, many have been dipped in water, at ſeverall times from an outward profeſſion, and after their converſation have declared them to be of Antichriſt, ſo both forms in both wayes, go to make up a Carnall Church for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
            <p>From unity in a form, for which there is no ground at all for, in the word of truth, but meerely from mens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall principles, conceits, and traditions, one never being commanded, nor any example of the practiſe of it, and the other in Force and in uſe, when other Ceremonies were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 5. Water-Baptiſme, keeps men in Fellowſhip, Love, and Unity among themſelves, ſo that they denyed no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> aſunder, as others do, and as they might, if they did not take up this form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Example teacheth us, that Unity in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall form, cannot keep people together in Unity, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and love; for many that have been, and are ſtill one in ſome forms, as water-Baptiſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they agree not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and at laſt, many have broken quite in pieces, and parted quite aſunder!</p>
            <p>Forms do commonly keep people together for their own ends and intereſts, therefore this Unity is not Goſpel-proof, but Antichriſtian Unity, for that is Antichriſtian Unity, that tyes up peoples love in one form.</p>
            <p>2. The people of God, who are called by his grace, and hath his love revealed in them, and do really live in God, and ſo in love, and ſo in the Unity of one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Spirit, by whom they are all led into all truth, faithfullneſſe, Love, fellowſhip, kindneſſe, tenderneſſe of heart, Bowels of Compaſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one to another, they need not to have any outward form of water, or any ſuch thing to keep them in Unity of Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118122:29"/> one Spirit in the Lord, but that one eternall Spirit that is in them all, who doth quicken them all, it being the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love in them all; this internall work of God in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on high, ſhed abroad in his peoples hearts, is of infinite more force to keep them in love, and fellowſhip with one another, in the Father, and the Son, than any earthly form, dipping, or ſprinckling a little cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you that are truly ſpirituall conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 6. That which was once commanded, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reverſed, or repealed, is ſtill in force, and water-Baptſme was once commanded, and never repealed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſtill in force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1. All Ceremonies were once commanded, yet no Ceremony is ſtill in force, for all Ceremonies ended (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the command of them) when the Subſtance came.</p>
            <p>2. Whatſoever was not a command in Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is not ſtill in force, becauſe not a command in Chriſts Kingdome, and water-Baptiſme was not a command in Chriſts Kingdome, but a fore-runner of it, as is clear by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Scriptures; therefore it is not ſtill in force, if you look, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> will tell you in ſeverall places, that it was a fore-runner of Chriſt, he being the miniſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and going before Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 7. The Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was from heaven, and the counſell of God, and they that reſiſted it, reſiſted the counſell of God againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1 I grant this to be a clear truth, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in its time, and place; but obſerve, all the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Laws, Ceremonies, ſhadows, types and figures, were once the commmands of God, and thoſe that obeyed them not, but reſiſted and refuſed them, they died without mercy under two or three witneſſes; but when it was all finiſhed, and the ends for which it was ordained, were accompliſhed, and the fullneſſe of time come, that the ſubſtance was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (which had been figured out in them) then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls them beggarly rudiments, and asks the Colloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

            <p>2. As thoſe that reſiſted <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme in its time, did reſiſt the counſell of God then<hi>:</hi> ſo theſe do now reſiſt the counſell of God, that do deny the Baptiſme of the Spirit, it being that adminiſtration of God, that is, ſpirit and life, and the very ſubſtance of what was figured out before.</p>
            <p>And if they reſiſted the counſell of God, that did reſiſt an outward and bodily waſhing, which was then appointed of God to go before the ſubſtance<hi>:</hi> what manner of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel do they reſiſt, that do reſiſt the Baptiſme of the eternall ſpirit, coming forth from the eternall God in all power in heaven and earth, which think you hath greateſt power in it? the foregoing figure, or the preſent ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Conſider of this, you that ſay, there is no ſpirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme now<hi>:</hi> is not this denying the power, and ſetting of a form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 8. That place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Where Chriſt gives his Diſciples Commiſſion <hi>to teach all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be meant of water-Baptiſme, for without water, no Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> 1. There is no other Baptiſme beſides water, or elſe <hi>John</hi> was out, when he bears witneſſe of another Baptiſme that ſhould come after his Baptiſme, and that it ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by another manner of perſon than he was, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>I indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do baptiſe you with water, but there is one that cometh after me, that is mightier than I, be ſhall baptiſe you with the holy Spirit, and with fire.</hi> So here you ſee all Baptiſme is not water, there is ſome fire-Baptiſme too.</p>
            <p>2. If the word of truth did not bear witneſſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of water, and waſhing by water beſides our earthly waters, then you had ſome ground for this conceit, but the Scriptures and ſpirituall ſouls, that are partakers of the true ſpirituall waſhing, purifying, and baptiſing in the ſtrength of all power, in heaven and earth; ſuch ſouls can with the word written bear witneſſe to another manner of Baptiſme and waſhing, than any earthly waſhing in earthly rivers.</p>
            <p>I have already, in the former part of this diſcourſe, born witneſſe to this true and Spirituall waſhing, I will onely
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118122:30"/> here cite ſome witneſſes of the written word that prove clearly another kind of water and of waſhing then mens wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings are in earthen fountains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.
4. <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 16. and <hi>cap.</hi> 47. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. and <hi>cap.</hi> 44. 3.
<hi>John</hi> 4. 14. <hi>John</hi> 7. 38, 39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1. 17.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, if you could make it appear clearly by the Word, that there were no other Waters, but our earthly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and no other waſhing, but our earthly waſhing<hi>:</hi> then you might alſo affirm there were no other Baptiſme, but with materiall Water<hi>:</hi> but till you can prove this, by the witnes of Truth, we cannot believe the Baptiſme in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.
19. Can be earthly Water, or earthly Waſhing, or earthly Baptiſme; but heavenly Water, heavenly Waſhing, heavenly Baptiſme, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to power from on high.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 9. Water Baptiſme is a command of Chriſt, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.
<hi>Go teach all nations, baptiſing them, &amp;c.</hi> Here is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſme given by command from Chriſt, and ſo we doe follow it upon this ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though I have already declared what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is; yet I ſhall alſo anſwer to this Objection in ſeveral particulars; Firſt there is not one word of materiall Water ſpoken of in this place; but the Commiſſion was to Baptiſe them, into the Name of God, or Father, Son, and Spirit; [nor no where elſe that I could yet ſee by Commiſſion from Chriſt] Therefore not material Water; for the name of God is not material water. [neither is this Baptiſme material Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.]</p>
            <p>2. Your interpretation is quite contrary to the nature of the Commiſſion; for materiall Water doth not ſuite with all power in heaven and earth (that being but an outward wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing; but all power in heaven and earth do accompliſh an inward and ſpiritual waſhing, and clenſing from ſin and all uncleanneſſe, which outward waſhing could not do<hi>:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore outward waſhing is contrary to the nature of Chriſts Commiſſion, as it is contrary to the name of God, and all power in Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>3.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118122:30"/> Water Baptiſme ſuites not with a diſpenſation that is wholly ſpirituall, but belonged to a precedent diſpenſation, that had paſſed before in
<hi>Johns</hi> time, of whom he was the right Adminiſtrator; and we never read of any that was ſent to Baptize with Water but <hi>John</hi> (as he declares he was<hi>:)</hi> let all Water-men in <hi>England</hi> come forth with ſuch a word from Chriſt or his Apoſtles; <hi>John</hi> 2.
33. and I will believe it (that they were ſent by command from Chriſt, to baptiſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial water.</p>
            <p>4. Water Baptiſme is contrary to the kingdome of Chriſt, which is within all Believers that are Believers indeed; and Chriſt would not give his Apoſtles a Commiſſion to practiſe that; which was contrary to his kingdome, or that was no part of it: for Water Baptiſme was a legall waſhing, and that which went before that ſpirituall adminiſtration, which Chriſt and
<hi>John</hi> alſo calls the kingdom of God and of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.
15. therefore Chriſt would not give his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Commiſſion to ſet up a ſhaddow in the room of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<hi>:</hi> for the kingdome of Chriſt is wholy ſpiritual, and comes not with outward ſhews or obſervations.</p>
            <p>But it conſiſts in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, and it is not brought forth in Saints by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervations.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it come unto them, in, with, by, or through any carnal, outward, or legall ordinance, as waſhing or the like; but in power from on high, wrought within them, by all power in heaven and earth<hi>:</hi> and now a Baptiſme of this nature do onely agree with ſuch a kingdome as this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in creatures are made partakers of the divine nature, their own corruptions being deſtroyed and waſhed away in the pure baptiſm of the eternall Spirit, this is the onely bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme that is agreeable with the pure ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. This interpretation of the Commiſſion is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true Goſpel-worſhip; which conſiſts in Spirit and Power from on high<hi>:</hi> for Water baptiſme is ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and ſuch worſhip, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi>
10. that was to continue untill the time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<hi>:</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118122:31"/> but when once the time of Reformation came, then no more outward and carnal Ordinance to be ſet up by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from Chriſt: but when the time of Reformation came, which was when Chriſt was glorified, and the Spirit given; then all worſhip was and is ſpiritual
<hi>(that was and is from God)</hi> we have two proofs of this, that Goſpel worſhip is ſpirituall, <hi>John</hi> 4. from <hi>v.</hi> 20. to 24. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Here is not confidence in fleſh nor fleſhly worſhip,</hi> let it be what it will; nor no joy nor delight in it<hi>:</hi> but thoſe that worſhip God, ſhould worſhip him in Spirit and Truth; and ſpiritual worſhip is the onely true worſhip in the ſpirituall kingdom of the Son and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>6. To affirm the Commiſſion to be meant of Water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as quite contrary to the clear Teſtimony of other ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, both from the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf, and the Apoſtles<hi>:</hi> and ſeeing it is clear by other Scriptures, that there is another baptiſme beſides Water baptiſme, and not one word of water in this place: How dare any to affirm the Commiſſion to be Water baptiſme? This is Antichriſt like to ſet in the Temple of God, and ſo confine Scriptures and mens Conſciences to their Carnal and Traditional Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſo to change Times and Laws, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. (or think to do it.)</p>
            <p>1. See thoſe Scriptures that are clear againſt this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5, 8. Here is another baptiſme ſpoken of by him who gave the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he calls it the Promiſe of the Father, Power from on high; and the baptiſme of the Holy Spirit: Now all this conſidered, how can we ſafely wring any material water out of the Commiſſion? Seeing the Author of the Commiſſion declareth another baptiſme ſo plainly; which is infinitely more ſuiteable to ſuch a Perſon, then an outward and bodily waſhing.</p>
            <p>2. See alſo the witneſſe of the Apoſtles, to another bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, beſides that of material water, <hi>Acts</hi> 11, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. beſides thoſe places ſpoken of in our former diſcourſe. If the Teſtimonies of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in their Epiſtles, and as the Word bears witneſſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118122:31"/> baptiſme: ſo alſo it doth bear witneſſe to another kind of Water, and of baptiſme, and of waſhing, beſides that of earthly water, as we have already declared.</p>
            <p>And that baptiſme, and that water and waſhing being onely ſuitable to the Power &amp; the Perſon here giving the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore it is alſo ſuitable to the Commiſſion given by ſuch a Perſon, in ſuch Power, for the accompliſhing a work ſuitable to ſuch a perſon, Power and Adminiſtration, which is wholly ſpirituall, and from above, not carnall, nor from beneath, nor from the Elements of this world (for all earthly things periſh with the uſing, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Paul</hi> declares plainly, that he was not ſent by Chriſt, to baptiſe with Water,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. when he is ſpeaking of water baptiſme; and this were ſufficient to ſatisfie all men if they were not byaſſed with the erroneous Traditions, and carnall Obſervations and underſtandings of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But here the old Objections will come in, that <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſent to baptiſe onely, but alſo to preach the Goſpel. But I could wiſh you would not forget the Concluſion of the New Teſtament, <hi>Revelation</hi> 22. 18, 19. and we may as well put in words in other places as here, (as for example) where the word ſaith, ſalvation is not of works, (we may put in onely) and read it thus, <hi>Not of works onely, but alſo of Grace;</hi> and ſo theſe words ſet up Antichriſt with a witneſſe.</p>
            <p>But now if this Commiſſion had been to baptiſe with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial water, then <hi>Paul</hi> had more reaſon to have had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to baptiſe ſo, than any of the Apoſtles, ſeeing he was to go into all the world, where no Ordinance of God had ever been, (but you will ſay, that others were to do this; but yet, if it had been a part of his Commiſſion, then he would have exhorted others to practiſe it, but we find no ſuch thing in all his Epiſtles unto any.</p>
            <p>But he gives God thanks that he baptiſed no more, <hi>v.</hi> 14. leſt they ſhould ſcandall him about it; but he was ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118122:32"/> zealous for all the commands of Chriſt, that he valued not his life, ſo it might be accompliſhed, and if this had been a command of Chriſt, he would not have cared who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed it, or him about it, for his work was to fulfill the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Jeſus Chriſt, or the Commiſſion of Chriſt, and not to reſpect what p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſons did ſay againſt him, in the fulfilling of it.</p>
            <p>But if water-Baptiſme were in the Commiſſion of Chriſt to the other Apoſtles, then
<hi>Paul</hi> had but a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt given unto him<hi>:</hi> for he was not ſent to baptiſe with water, and ſo Chriſt gave a whole Commiſſion to ſome, and but a piece to the reſt.</p>
            <p>8. If water-Baptiſme muſt be meant here, then in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where Baptiſme is ſpoke if, it muſt be meant of water, though water be not named, as here it is not. This is to cheat the people, and to tell them, this is the naturall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word here<hi>:</hi> do but obſerve how this doth croſſe other Scriptures, as <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 50. <hi>Matth,</hi> 2. 1.
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 16. here one word is uſed for ſeverall Baptiſmes, (we may well ſay, wiſe men are ſimple)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 10 Spirit-Baptiſm conſiſts in viſible gifts, given in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo all thoſe places that ſpeak of Spirit-Baptiſme are to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. I deny this upon theſe grounds: Firſt, gifts are no where called Spirit-Baptiſme; but that gifts were a part of it I do not deny, though they were not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.</p>
            <p>2. The Apoſtle declares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. that all were by one Spirit baptiſed into one body, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, bound or free, (let them be what they will) but all were not partakers of ſuch viſible gifts, as you would have called Spirit Baptiſme, as appears in the ſame chap. 29, 30. which is to ſpeak with tongues, work miracles, as heal the ſick,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which all could never do.</p>
            <p>3. If Chriſts Baptiſme, did conſiſt onely in viſible gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then
<hi>John</hi> was not out, when he declared the Baptiſme
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118122:32"/> of Chriſt, to be mighty, to the through cleanſing of his people from their finnes and corruptions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>4. The ſubſtance of Spirit-Baptiſme conſiſts in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Father, which we have heard of the Sonne, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. as he himſelf hath declared, now the promiſe of the Father, doth conſiſt in more than viſible gifts, as appears by ſeverall teſtimonies of Chriſt, unto his Apoſtles, let us obſerve ſome particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The promiſe of the Father, was more than viſible gifts, for it was the eternall Spirit which ſhould be unto them an everlaſting comforter, that ſhould abide with them for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 17. now the Spirit of truth, that was to abide with them for ever, and to be their comforter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, was more than viſible gifts, which continued but for a time.</p>
            <p>Again, the Promiſe of the Father, which was the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and comforter, whom the Father would ſend in the name of the Son, ſhould teach them all things cocerning the great myſterie of God, and bring all things to their remembrance that the Sonne had before declared unto them, which is more than viſible gifts as you ſay.</p>
            <p>3. The promiſe of the Father conſiſts in power from on high: as Chriſt declareth to his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. Behold I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you (but what is that? he bids them tarry in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they were endued with Power from on high, here is the Promiſe of the Father, that was to come upon them, even power from on high, and this ſpirit and power from on high being poured forth, <hi>Turned the barren Wilderneſſe into a fruitfull field,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 15. it enabled the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to do great things, beſides viſible gifts, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others.</p>
            <p>They were hereby enabled to preach the great myſtery of ſalvation to all the world, and there went forth ſuch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118122:33"/> a power in their miniſtry, that it threw down the whole Kingdome of the Devil in peoples hearts, and made it all flee in pieces before it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It wrought ſo mightily in them, that it comforted them agaimſt all affliction they met with, either inward or outward: it filled their hearts and ſpirits with abundance of peace, Joy, and ſpirituall comfort, which the world could not give nor receive, <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. 27. now this and the like, is more than viſible gifts, except you will ſay, the whole work of God, in bringing his people into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and enjoyment of the great ſalvation, be all viſible gifts or the Baptiſme of gifts.</p>
            <p>4. The whole myſtery of all, doth meet in one and the ſame things, as the promiſe of the Father, power from on high, and the Baptiſme of the ſpirit; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the 14, 15, 16. chapters of <hi>John,</hi> with <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. and <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. 8. and all theſe do agree in one and the ſame thing, (namely ſpirit-Baptiſme) we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for proof hereof than <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. in v. 3. it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he was ſeen of them ſorty dayes after he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the things he ſpeaks of were concerning the Kingdome of God (let us conſider by the way, what that is;) and then <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and being aſſembled together with them, commanded them that they ſhould not depart from
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but wait for the promiſe of the Father, which ſaith he, <hi>Ye have heard of me; For</hi> John <hi>truly, baptiſed with water, but ye ſhall be baptiſed with the holy Spirit not many dayes hence.</hi> Here is the promiſe of the Father, power from on high, (as in
<hi>verſe</hi> 8.) and Spirit-Baptiſme meeting all in one, as clear as the light.</p>
            <p>So now from clear teſtimonies of the word, we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Subſtantiall part of Spirit-Baptiſme doth conſiſt in the inward work of God wrought in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuitable to the promiſe of the Father, and power from on high, and this conſiſts in comforting, ſupporting, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peace, joy, and reſt of Spirit unto them, not in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118122:33"/> world, but in Chriſt, in whom dwells the fullneſſe of God.</p>
            <p>And alſo in breaking in pieces the Kingdome of Satan, and opening the eyes of the blind, and turning many from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</p>
            <p>And in opening rivers in high places, and turning the wilderneſſe into pools of water, and giving water to the thirſty, and reſt to the very ſouls, and binding up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted, and waſhing away the filth of the daughters of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the eternall fountain of living water, pouring out a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them, and his ſpirit upon their ofspring (with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more precious promiſes of the Father, all being fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Baptiſme of the Spirit, as the Father and the Son had promiſed, and ſo it was fulfilled in Spirit and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on high.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 11. All believers in all ages, had faith and the works of God wrought in them, in turning them from ſin to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet we never read it was called Spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, therefore it is not meant of the great work of God, in waſhing and ſaving his people from ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it muſt be ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Here is <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> his ignorance with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for becauſe the work of God in his people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes, was not called the new birth to be born from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, to be born of water and the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore there was no ſuch thing as he thought, for he had a carnall apprehenſion of the great work Chriſt ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Chriſt by night, ſo I doubt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do come to Chriſt in the dark now, and ſo they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the great work of Chriſt, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was, for you are as much out now, that cannot believe there is any ſpirit-baptiſme now, becauſe it was not ſo called before Chriſt came, or that there was none before Chriſt came, becauſe not called ſo, you may as well ſay, there was no Goſpel, nor born from above, nor no ſpirituall birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe not ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118122:34"/> called, and ſo with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> diſcover your ignorance:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 12. VVater-Baptiſme was uſed after Spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme came in force, yea, among the Jews and Gentiles, and the Apoſtles themſelves did alſo practiſe it, therefore it is ſtill in force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Not ſo, for though the Apoſtles uſed it yet not by Commiſſion nor by Command from Chriſt, for there is not one word in all the Scripture more or leſſe, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by any Apoſtle, either in their Preaching or Writing Epiſtles to the Churches, that they had any command from Chriſt to baptiſe with Water.</p>
            <p>Nay, further, there is not any teſtimony in the Word, that ever Water baptiſme was called the baptiſme of Chriſt, (but of <hi>John)</hi> and ſeeing we have no proof to call it Chriſts ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, why then ſhall we ſubmit to it as the Ordinance of Chriſt, and commanded by him, which is no where called his, nor none ſent by him to practiſe it<hi>:</hi> Indeed we read <hi>John was ſent to Baptiſe with Water,</hi> but ſhew me ſuch a proof from any Apoſtle? or, where Chriſt ſaid, Go Baptiſe all Nations with Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That Jews and Gentiles uſed Water baptiſme, makes nothing for the perpetuity of it, for all ceremonies were practiſed in thoſe dayes, as well Circumciſion, Jewiſh Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and obſerving meats and drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſme.</p>
            <p>And Water baptiſme being a Ceremony laſt took up, what infallible proof can any give, why that ſhould be firſt laid down? or why it may not be in uſe as long as others in thoſe dayes, or longer? ſeeing it was ſo rare, that the people thought the Author of it to be the Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. Why might not ſome be zealous for this Ordinance that was adminiſtred under the ſecond diſpenſation; as well as many thouſands were zealous for Circumciſion, which was given out under the former diſpenſation; and all this when the ſubſtance was come, even the third diſpenſation, which was in it ſelf wholy ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:118122:34"/> 4. Water baptiſme was ſo rare, that it founded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the World, there being many people of all Nations at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and many Proſelytes, who were joyned to the Church of the Jews: and Water baptiſme being an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ceremony among the Jews, and in its inſtitution, the command of God, they were abundantly confirmed in it, as others were in other things that were once the commands of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 13. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the people to repent, and be baptiſed every one of them, <hi>In the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> for the Remiſſion of ſins, and they ſhould receive the gifts of the holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is to be practiſed by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſame Apoſtle in the next Chapter bids the people <hi>repent and be converted,</hi> that their ſins may be blotted out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that we may obſerve that Repentance, Baptiſme, and Converſion do agree in one; and the Apoſtle doth not bid them be baptiſed in Water, but in, or unto the name of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom alone there was hope of Remiſſion of Sins (but if you do ſtill affirm this to be Water baptiſme,) yet you can plead neither command nor Commiſſion from Chriſt; neither doth the Apoſtle ſay, that Chriſt did give him a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to baptiſe them in VVater who did repent.</p>
            <p>2. Upon this Repentance and Baptiſme, here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the gifts of the ſpirit to follow, but where doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low water baptiſme? (and if you would have this to be Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſme) then look to it that the gifts of the ſpirit doe follow it, or elſe it is to no purpoſe to uſe it, if the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects do not follow, and <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 46,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Gentiles had the gifts of the ſpirit, and were baptiſed with water afterward, theſe do not agree.</p>
            <p>3. For the Promiſe is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call; here is the ſubſtance of all declared, even the promiſe of the Spirit<hi>:</hi> But what is this promiſe? Is it Water baptiſm that is ſo much cryed up in the World? that was unto them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118122:35"/> and their children, and to all that are afarre off.</p>
            <p>No it is not Water-Baptiſme, but it is Spirit-Baptiſme, ſee v. 33. compared with this, it is the promiſe of the ſpirit, that is unto them and to their children, and to all that were afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. So here it is the promiſe of the Spirit, that is unto them, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to all that are afar off, and not Water-baptiſme.</p>
            <p>And here we may adde one thing more, in anſwer to the tenth Objection, that the baptiſme of the Spirit, cannot be underſtood of gifts onely, for it is to continue unto ſo many as the Lord ſhall call, who were then afar off, and are yet afar off, who are yet unborn, for it is unto all the Lord ſhall call, but thoſe gifts were not to continue, but for a time, for the preſent occaſion, as none can deny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 14. But <hi>Peter</hi> commanded ſome to be baptiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 10 48. no man can deny this to be Water-baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is but <hi>Peters</hi> command, not the command of Chriſt, neither doth <hi>Peter,</hi> here, declare one word, that Chriſt had given him a Commiſſion to do it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not firſt command this to be done, till there was a controverſie among the people about it, (as we may obſerve by the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 46. <hi>Then anſwered Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> but ſure he would not anſwer to nothing, there was ſomething ſpoken about it.</p>
            <p>3. We never read of any that were baptiſed with water till they did deſire it, it was not laid upon any ſimply as a command, as believing and obedience to all Spirituall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes were, but they were baptiſed ſo, when they deſired it, as other Ceremonies were uſed, in reference to the peoples condition, as it was in this place.</p>
            <p>4. The new converted Gentiles were of tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as were the Jews, and if this Ordinance that was ſo rare, and in ſo high eſteem, ſhould not have been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto them, they would have ſtumbled at it, not being able to ſee beyond it<hi>:</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle did it, that ſo they might not ſtumble nor be offended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118122:35"/> Fifthly, When <hi>Peter</hi> wrote his Epiſtle, he takes off the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quite from water-baptiſm, and tells them of a baptiſm that there was, but ſaith he, Not the waſhing away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God by the reſurrection of Chriſt: the power and vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection, was the ſtrength and ſubſtance of the true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and this conſiſted in the anſwer of a good Conſcience, being cleanſed by the waters of the Spirit, in the baptiſm of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But for ground that <hi>Peter</hi> had a Commiſſion from Chriſt to baptize with water, I never yet ſaw any.</p>
            <p>Obj. 15 <hi>The Apoſtles laid nothing upon the people by way of Command, but what they had Commiſſion from Chriſt for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Apoſtles did never preach water-baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people as a command of Chriſt; neither declared it in their Epiſtles, as a command of Chriſt, nay, they never preacht it in their Miniſtery at all; which is cleer that it was not a Command of Chriſt: for in the Commiſſion they were to teach men to obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; but if water-baptiſm had been a Command of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, then they would as frequently preacht it to the people in their Miniſtery, as any other part of their Commiſſion, or of that they were commanded to preach. But ſometimes after they had preacht, and the people queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they did ſpeak of it according to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples weakneſs.</p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Peter</hi> preaches according to his Commiſſion, and according to the promiſe, the ſpirit falls upon the people, and here <hi>Peter</hi> remembers the words of Chriſt, which was, that <hi>John</hi> had baptiſed with water, but that they ſhould be baptized with the Spirit; and here the people ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the work of God: now here is baptiſm declared by the Apoſtle, but not a word of water-baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Obſerve here, the people ſpeak not of water-baptiſm, and <hi>Peter</hi> never puts them in minde of it neither, but he mindes them of Chriſts baptiſm, now he remembers it, by the ſeeing it fulfilled.</p>
            <p>But if water-baptiſm had been a Command of Chriſt, then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118122:36"/> the Apoſtles would have exhorted the people to it everywhere when any had been converted.</p>
            <p>But we never finde they exhorted any, or commanded any to take it up, but when the people deſired it, therefore they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid it upon any as a command of Chriſt: but when it was commanded or exhorted unto by them, it was to ſatisfie the Conſciences of the weak who did deſire it.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> reaſons as he doth, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 45, 46, 47 is to ſatisfie thoſe of the Circumciſion that came with <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſo they might not hinder the Gentiles from taking up wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptiſm, ſeeing they deſired it. But where there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion made about it, there he doth not lay it upon them, as is cleer.</p>
            <p>3 We have cleer proof that <hi>Paul</hi> doth command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort believers of all ſorts, to bear one with another, and not to offend one another in obſerving, or not obſerving meats, and drinks, days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all theſe did concern Moſaical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and obſervations, and had no relation to <hi>Pauls</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which was to preach the Goſpel, and Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor Ceremonies: and for proof of this, that <hi>Paul</hi> was to preach the Goſpel, and had Commiſſion for no more, read <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>And yet that <hi>Paul</hi> did command and exhort people to other things in reference to this condition, we have proof in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we have alſo <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon why he did ſo, to the Jews he became a Jew, and to the Gentiles he became a Gentile; yea he ſaith, that he became all things unto all, that he might win ſome. So we ſee, that all that was impoſed upon the people in thoſe times, was in reference to their ſtrength or weakneſs, ſome being for ſtrong meat, and ſome for herbs; ſome for one Ceremony, ſome for another.</p>
            <p>Many thouſands of the Jews for Circumciſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. and many for water-baptiſm, many for obſerving days, meats, drinks, new-moons, Sabbaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all once commands of God, and therefore not eaſily laid aſide, ſeeing they made Conſcience of them as commands of God.</p>
            <p>And we may ſee it in our days, how zealous people are for ancient Cuſtoms anſt Obſervations, though never the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118122:36"/> of God: how much more zealous might the people be in thoſe days for the things that were once the commands of God?</p>
            <p>And further, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is much out himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. when he compelleth the Gentiles to live as do the Jews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which <hi>Paul</hi> reproves him openly: and now what will you make of <hi>Peters</hi> commanding the Genriles to be baptized in one place, ſeeing Chriſts Command is not mentioned?</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> declares in another place, that he was not ſent of Chriſt to baptize, and yet he did baptize with water, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles might, and did do things without Command or Commiſſion from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So you cannot for all this, prove water-baptiſm to be the command of Chriſt, but that it was uſed as other Ceremonies were, ſeeing the chief Apoſtle uſed it without Commiſſion from Chriſt, for he could not have Commiſſion for that he was not ſent to do.</p>
            <p>Obj. 16. <hi>But we have more to object concerning the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Mat. 28.
<hi>baptizing the people into the name of God our Father, Son and Spirit, is into the profeſſion of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, this is contrary to your own principles, for you ſay that people are firſt to profeſs Chriſt, believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be baptized with water; beſides, this was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice when water-baptiſm was in uſe, that people ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profeſs the way of God before they were baptized in water, therefore this cannot be the meaning of Chriſt in the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>2 This is the way to ſet up a Jewiſh and Moſaical Church ſtill, to make Chriſtians by a bare profeſſion, and taking up an outward form. But this is not ſutable to a Goſpel-diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein people are made Chriſtians from an inward work, as writing of divine Laws in their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not from a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cold water in outſide of them.</p>
            <p>3 There is more in the being baptized into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Spirit, then a bare outſide profeſſion of God, as men do carnally underſtand.</p>
            <p>There is infinitely more myſtery in the name of God, then you think of or imagine, by your going about to binde up the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118122:37"/> name of God in a form, and confine it to an outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, and to this purpoſe, conſider a few particulars, though we have declared it before.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By partaking of the name of God, people are the ſons and daughters of God, as the Scripture declares, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 7. and this is from the pretenſe of God dwelling in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Not from a bare profeſſion of the Name of God, as creatures do carnally underſtand: ſhew me one Scripture that we are ſons and daughters of God by an outward profeſſion, and taking up an out form of water, or the like in Goſpel-times, or whether we are not ſons and daughters by the preſence of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us, in ſpirit and power from on high? in which we do truly partake of the name of God, in all Goſpel-times.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Thoſe that do partake of the Name of God, they are ſo named of the Lord himſelf; they ſhall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord ſhall name; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.
2. What think you? is there no difference between the name of God that we are made partakers of, by the Lords naming, even by the ſpirit of his mouth, in power from on nigh, and an empty name that creatures have by going into water? Oh conſider! as the power of God is higher then ours, his thoughts higher then ours, his ways higher then ours: ſo is his name that he gives us in the baptiſm of the ſpirit, higher and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then our name taken from our beggerly rudiments of this world.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God doth ſet thoſe on high that do know his name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13. but dipping creatures into the water cannot make them partakers of the name of God, nor the effect thereof, which is to ſet them on high; for many may know the name of God by an outward profeſſion, and may be called the people of God by partaking of an empty form, as dipping or ſprinkling with, or in water; and yet they may be far enough from being ſet on high by the mighty God: ſo dipping in water cannot inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt us in the name of God, therefore this cannot be the ſcope of the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This name of God that his people do partake of in the baptiſm of the ſpirit, it is given to them by the Lord; and they
<pb facs="tcp:118122:37"/> are partakers of it by his mighty power, I will give them a new name, ſaith God,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. God gives his people a white ſtone and in the ſtone a new name written, that none knows, but he that hath it, this is the new Name that God brings forth in his people in the new nature, written in them by the eternal Spirit.</p>
            <p>And none knoweth this white ſtone, nor the name written in it, but thoſe that have received it; and this onely is an eternal name that ſhall never be blotted out, it being the name of the living God, and written by a divine power in the new man, or new name, which is the white ſtone, the eternal word brought forth in us, in which God writes his own name, which is the name of all names; and ſo we do become living and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious ſtones, by partaking of the divine nature in him, who is the foundation of all precious ſtones, being laid of the Father, the onely precious ſtone, and chief corner-ſtone, by whoſe vertue we do become pure, white, and precious ſtones, builded up together for an habitation of eternal being through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and operation of the eternal Spirit.</p>
            <p>But the waters of this world can never baptize us into this name, nor give us this name, nor write this name in us.</p>
            <p>But the name any have by going into water, is ſuch a name as all may read, becauſe it is an external name, and it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter name then <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may partake of, yea any wicked perſon, (is not this giving holy things to dogs?) I mean the name of God, not water-baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But he that hath the name given him of God in the baptiſm of the eternal Chriſt, none can read it, or know it, but he that hath it; therefore water-baptiſm is not that name, neither can it give this name unto any, nor baptize any into this name.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Water-baptiſm cannot intereſt people into the name of God, for Chriſt hath promiſed to write the name of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, yea he will write upon them his own new name,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. here we ſee, it is the work of him who hath all power in heaven and earth, to write the name of God upon ſouls, and this is done in the power of the eternal ſpirit, not by dipping in water. For water-baptiſm is not the name of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118122:38"/> God, neither can it work ſuch effects upon ſouls, as to bring forth the name of God in them, nor to write the name of God upon them. Creatures are onely partakers of the precious name of God, by power from on high; not by a little cold water.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have any experience of the name and nature of God in themſelves, and thoſe that are not wilfully blinde, they may ſee or hear what the name of God is: if you look but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the word written in the Scriptures, that will tell you what the name of God is, and Gods name and nature is one.</p>
            <p>You know the Name of God is declared in Scripture to be Love, Mercy, Goodneſs, Light, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with many the like, and I hope none that knows and loves the truth, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that the glorious Name of the eternal God doth conſiſt in a bare outſide profeſſion, taking its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from dipping in a little cold water, and that thoſe who are intereſted into this glorious name, that it is from their being thrown into a brook of earthly water (there cannot be a more carnal conceit then this.)</p>
            <p>The Commiſſion is to baptize people into the name of God, and that is declared to be Love, Goodneſs, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I hope no man will ſay, water-baptiſm is the Name of God, that doth conſiſt in all good, ſutable to his Nature, nor that to be baptized into the Name of God, that conſiſts in Light, Love, Wiſdom, Purity, Strength, Fruitfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that this is into material water.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, in the baptiſm of the ſpirit, which conſiſts in power from on high, we are dipt and waſhed in the pure River of the water of life, that proceeds from the Lord God, and from the Lamb, and this is the onely baptiſm in Chriſts pure and ſpiritual kingdom, which conſiſts in ſpiritual fire, and ſpiritual water, and this ſpiritual fire will lick up all our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waters, and quite deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>In a word, this fire and water of the ſpirit, burns up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys, waſteth away, and cleanſeth us from all filthineſs, both of ſpirit ſoul and body, in which way we do come to live in the name and nature of God in holineſs and righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:118122:38"/> And thus we may ſee, that material water is not the Name of God, nor to be baptized into the Name of God, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earthly waters, but it is into Life, Light, Love, Wiſdom, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, into the divine nature, for as we have firſt been partakers of the earthly, even the old man which is corrupt and ſinful; So in the baptiſm of the ſpirit, we do partake of the new name, or are made new men in him who is the Lord from heaven; and ſuch a baptiſm is onely ſuitable to all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, which is able to write the Name of God upon his people, and in them, and whoſoever do call themſelves by the name of God, or are called by his name from any outward form in the time of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

So we conclude, the Commiſſion is ſpiritual, and conſiſts in ſpiritual baptiſm, even power from on high, ſutable to the perſon that gave it, and alſo to the diſpenſation, which was wholly ſpiritual: and ſo intereſts us into the name of God, which our earthly water cannot do, for that cannot inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt us into eternal Love, Light, and all good; as ſpirit-baptiſm can and doth.</p>

            <p>2 You do manifeſt abundance of ignorance in this, not to diſtinguiſh between the efficient cauſe, and the inſtrumental cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:118122:39"/> Now in the firſt place, we aſcribe the whole work of the baptiſm of the ſpirit unto God alone, as the author and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof, in ſpirit and divine power; and that God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this great work by means, this we do alſo affirm.</p>
            <p>And to this end, Chriſt gave his Apoſtles a Commiſſion to go forth in the ſtrength of power from on high, and teach all Nations, and in this Miniſtery, they were inſtruments in the hand of God, to ſprinkle the name of God upon the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their very Miniſtery being power from on high, for they were not to go forth till they had received power from on high,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 8.</p>
            <p>And ſo as inſtruments, inabled by all power in heaven and earth, they went forth in the Miniſtery of the Spirit, and in this ſpiritual adminiſtration God made them inſtruments to baptize men into the Name of God, the power of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent in their Miniſtery, for the accompliſhing of this great work: and ſo, though it be the work of God alone, to baptize with the Spirit, yet when it pleaſeth God to pour out his ſpirit in ſuch a way, and by ſuch means, for the effecting ſo great a work; and to give out ſuch treaſure in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that the power, glory, and praiſe may be of God alone, what is man that he ſhould oppoſe it, or deny it? Oh man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou art in the hand of thy Maker, as the clay is in the hand of the potter: and God hath made his Miniſters a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life unto ſome, and a ſavor of death unto others, and who is ſufficient for theſe things? None but thoſe whoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God alone.</p>
            <p>3 The ſame power that enables men to turn men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God, the ſame power doth enable men to baptize with the ſpirit; and we do read,
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. that God ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to turn men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why then not to baptize with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? for it is alike unpoſſible for men to do the one, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by their own power; and if you will deny the one, then you may as well deny the other, and ſo turn the truth into a lie: but let God be true, and every man a lyar, who is oppoſer of truth.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Paul</hi> declares that he had in Jeſus Chriſt begotten the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118122:39"/> 
               <hi>Corinthians</hi> through the Goſpel; <hi>Paul</hi> was here an inſtrument in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, to beget ſons and daughters unto God, and ſo he was their Father in Chriſt, in the Spirit and in the Goſpel; the Miniſtery of the Spirit, (1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.) and why then not to baptize men into the name of God, which conſiſts in all good, as well as to beget them unto God? what difference can you make here here? Seeing the ſubſtance is all one.</p>
            <p>5 We have another proof of the mighty effect of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Miniſtery, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
2, 3, <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: Ye are manifeſtly declared the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us; written not with ink, but with the ſpirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tables of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here, firſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were an Epiſtle written by the Apoſtles. Secondly, they were manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt. Thirdly, Miniſtred by the Apoſtles. Fourthly, written by the Spirit of the living God, in the hearts of the people. Here it is cleer, that God made men inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through the power and operation of the eternal Spirit, for the writing of the Law of the ſpirit of life upon their hearts, and ſo herein is the great Goſpel-promiſe fulfilled, in this Miniſtery of writing the Laws of God in his peoples hearts, and putting his Spirit in them, and cauſing them to walk in his ways, all this is fulfilled by inſtruments in the hand of divine power, and this agreeth with ſpirit-baptiſm exactly.</p>
            <p>5 But that things may be cleared in plain words, conſider <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. here is waſhing mentioned, and it is by the word, and this hath exact relation to the Commiſſion,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 28. the Apoſtles had Commiſſion to preach to the world, and in their Miniſtery to baptize the Nations into the name of God.</p>
            <p>And here is declared that Chriſt uſeth the word in this great work of ſanctifying, clenſing, and purifying the Church; that he might ſanctifie and clenſe it, with the waſhing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the word.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtles were to preach the word, and ſo in the Miniſtery of the word preached by the Apoſtles, this great work of waſhing and clenſing ſouls through the power of the eternal ſpirit was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:118122:40"/> And ſo it is cleer to thoſe that have eyes to ſee, that the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who are indued with power from on hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, they are made inſtruments in the hand of all power in heaven and earth, for the effecting the great work of ſpirit-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, wherein creatures are made partakers of the name and nature of God, and ſo they are waſhed, clenſed, ſanctified, and made pure and holy, yea an habitation for the Lord of glory; and ſo they are clenſed with the waſhing of water by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word, which is the Miniſtery of the ſpirit, that giveth life, and all good.</p>
            <p>Obj. 18. <hi>This baptiſm ſpoke of in the Commiſſion, cannot be meant of ſpirit-baptiſm; becauſe the ſpirit is not given in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but in a promiſe; and the Commiſſion is a precept, Go teach,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How is it poſſible men can be ſo ignorant, that they cannot believe there is a promiſe in all power in heaven and earth? and ſo blinde, that they cannot ſee it? (or will not) for if men could but ſee, they might behold a promiſe in the Commiſſion, for he that gave them the Commiſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them to be with them always, even unto the end.</p>
            <p>And if he unto whom all power was given, would be with them unto the end, then ſure a promiſe would be with them; yea and more then a promiſe: for all promiſes were with them, and all power with them; ſeeing he would be with them, in whom all promiſes are Yea and Amen, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p>2 The Miniſtery they were to go forth in, was the whole myſtery of God op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld, into the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of himſelf in light and love.</p>
            <p>3 Chriſt who gave the Apoſtles a Commiſſion to go and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118122:40"/> teach all Nations, he alſo commanded them not to depart from
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till they had received the promiſe of the Father, but to wait there till they were endued with power from on high, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 8. <hi>And behold, I ſend the promiſe of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the city of Jeruſalem, until ye be indued with power from on high,</hi> Luke 24. 49. (if this be not a promiſe, I know none.)</p>
            <p>Now here you may read the truth that you do oppoſe, and behold your own ignorance, and ſit down in ſilence, and cover your lips for ſhame.</p>
            <p>Obj. 19. <hi>If no water-baptiſm, then no Miniſtery, nor no right calling to preach: and we may as well deny one, as the other,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here I ſay as you do, though in another ſence; if we are not baptized with the ſpirit, then we are no true Miniſters of the ſpirit: and then we have no ground to preach. So our ground to preach doth ariſe from our being baptized, though not with material water.</p>
            <p>For I do affirm from Scripture and Reaſon, that a man may be baptized in water, and yet be as far from having any ground to preach, that he may be an enemy to the true Miniſtery of God in ſpirit and power from on high.</p>
            <p>For no man can deny, but a wicked man may be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water, and ſo baptized in water. And we have example, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized with water, and yet no right to preach.</p>
            <p>2. Though the Apoſtles had received a Commiſſion from Chriſt to go and teach all Nations, yet they were not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, till they were indued with power from on high.</p>
            <p>And now let me ask any of you, or all of you, who pretend a Calling to preach, either from going into water, or from mens laying hands upon you, yea from any external ordination which is from man whatſoever;</p>
            <p>How you do dare to go and call your ſelves Miniſters of Chriſt and of the Goſpel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> from a bare outward calling, and yet are without either a Commiſſion from Chriſt, or power from on high either? (the Apoſtles were not to go till they had both.)</p>
            <p>But you do go to teach without a Commiſſion, or power
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118122:41"/> from on high; and what is this, but to run before you are ſent?</p>
            <p>But here I would not be miſtaken, as if I were againſt all that do teach: no, I am really for all that do go forth in the ſtrength of God, in whoſe hearts and mindes God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his divine Laws, and hath given them life and power from on high, who are able Miniſters of the Spirit, and diſcerners of ſpirits in the light and wiſdom of the eternal Spirit; and do hear the voice of God in their own ſouls, and do ſpeak from the teachings of God in themſelves.</p>
            <p>So I hope you do ſee that thoſe whom God doth teach, they have a right to teach others, though not hereunto ordained by earthly water, nor any tradition of men, taken up from a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal underſtanding of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But if men do not ſee this truth, it is becauſe of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and blindneſs, and want of experience in the myſtery of truth.</p>
            <p>Obj. 20. <hi>But here you will ſay, The Apoſtles were to go forth in an extraordinary work, to teach all the world, to ſpeak with new tongues, work miracles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but now ordinary gifts will ſerve for to teach our own Nations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I grant they were to be indued with tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet the ſubſtance of all did conſiſt in the internal work that was wrought in them, for though they could not ſpeak to all Nations, except they did ſpeak in their languages; yet this was not the ſubſtance <hi>viz.</hi> their ſpeaking ſeveral languages; but there was a divine power went forth in their Miniſtery; and had it not been for power from on high, their word would have been no more effectual upon the people, then the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt and his Apoſties was before among the Jews, before the ſpirit was given.</p>
            <p>2 There is as much need of power from on high now, in thoſe that declare the myſtery of God in the world; for now all people generally are fixed upon the forms and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the former ages, ſet up by antichriſt, from a carnal underſtanding of the myſtery of God.</p>
            <p>And the man of ſin, and myſtery of iniquity have ſo blinded the hearts, mindes, and underſtandings of all Nations, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118122:41"/> they cannot behold the glorious light of the Goſpel, but they are in Egyptian darkneſs, the darkneſs and ſmoke of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, and the falſe lights of antichriſt have ſo blinded and dazled the eys of all the world, that they cannot behold the glorious light of God. If you would ſee Scripture for this purpoſe, to declare this to be truth, See 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> with <hi>Matth.</hi>
24, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now a Miniſtery that muſt deſtroy ſuch a myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſuch a man of ſin, that have deceived all Nations for this twelve hundred yeers or more, had need be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſtery; (I know not what you mean by your ordinary gifts, but) I know it is an extraordinary work muſt do this.</p>
            <p>For I think that is extraordinary that hath force enough in it to deſtroy, throw down, and quite deſtroy, all the building that man hath been ſetting up this many generations; yea his very gods and all.</p>
            <p>But that there ſhall be ſuch a final deſtruction come upon the man of ſin, and myſtery of iniquity, it is cleer by the word, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. here is ſo cleer a teſtimony of the deſtruction of the man of ſin, and myſtery of iniquity, ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4,
6, 7. that it is undenyable.</p>
            <p>And now what think you? Is not the ſpirit of Gods mouth power from on high? and is not the brightneſs of his coming the light of God? then where are your ordinary gifts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy antichriſt? but I adviſe you, that you be ſure your buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be of God, and not of ſelf, for if it be below the power of God in ſpirit, and below the brightneſs of God, then when God comes forth in ſpirit and brightneſs, he will aſſuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, root and branch, head and tayl.</p>
            <p>And now I can conclude no otherwiſe but thus, that the Miniſtery that God will ſend forth from the ſpirit of his mouth, and that ſhall appear in the bright and cleer light of God in his coming, (for the deſtruction of the man of ſin, and myſtery of iniquity) it ſhall conſiſt in power from on high, and in the true light of life. And let all that dwell upon earthly principles look to it, when God puts the ſpirit of life into his witneſſes, they ſhall finde theſe are no ordinary wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, nor gifts in them, but extraordinary.</p>

            <p>But many now adays look ſo much upon carnal Ordinances and outward obſervations, that their love is wholly upon that, and thoſe that follow thoſe forms, they are undone.</p>

            <p>Here is the cunning of the devil, to break in pieces the bonds of love and unity among thoſe that profeſs the Lord Jeſus.</p>

Let not the rich ſlight the poor (nor let not their benevolence be tyed up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſingle forms) and remember this, that <hi>pure religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widdows, in their afflictions, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world,</hi> Jam. 1. 27. here are Ordinances enough everywhere in the word of God, I could wiſh they were in our hearts too,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118122:44"/> for here are Ordinances enough for us to practiſe, if water were quite down.</p>
            <p>Remember, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. that the ſtong ſhould not ſlight nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the weak, nor the weak ſhould not contemn the ſtrong, but let all keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You may take them exhortations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. from <hi>John</hi> to the people, and alſo many more in the word of truth, onely I thought it good to put you in minde of a few, that ſo ye may ſee there are other Ordinances beſides cold water, and ſuch as there is a thouſand times more ground to practiſe, then you have for water-baptiſm, and that will be more in force when the other doth appear to be no Ordinance at all.</p>
            <p>But now to the latter part of your Objection, that this is the way to bring in ranting principles, if we deny water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be an Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, muſt carnal liberty be brought into the Church of Chriſt, if that be not ſet up and practiſed there, which Chriſt never commanded? this is very ſtrange.</p>
            <p>2 Is this the way to bring in carnal liberty and ranting principles among believers, to exalt the work of all power in heaven and earth? I thought that creature-exaltation, ſelf-ſeeking, and ſetting up idols, had been the way to bring in carnal liberty and ranting principles: when theſe things are impoſed upon creatures, to make up an out-ſide ſociety, then take heed of ranting.</p>
            <p>3 God doth according to his promiſe write his righteous and holy, juſt and good laws, in his peoples hearts, and puts his fear in them, that ſo they may never depart from him, and hath ſaid they ſhall not depart from him any more, and that he will be their God, and they ſhall be his people; that he will live in them and dwell among them, and they ſhall be all taught of him, and great ſhall be their peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I hope this is not the way to bring in ranting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and carnal liberty among the people of God, who are thus taught of God, and do live in the law of the ſpirit of life that is in Chriſt, who is their life and their all.</p>
            <p>The Law of God written in his peoples hearts doth no way
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118122:45"/> bring in ranting principles into their mindes, but theſe; that is, unto the kingdom of the devil and antichriſt, that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſin and all unrighteouſneſs, and in empty forms, traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and precepts of men, who proceed from fleſhly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principles in the world, and carnal Church.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you, that the Law of God written in his peoples hearts and mindes, this is the moſt rantingeſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to theſe, that can be upon the face of the earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God writes his Laws in his peoples hearts, and brings forth the new creation in them, and ſo makes them partakers of the divine nature, then let antichriſt and all his carnal priviledges look for a final rooting out, and an eternal deſtruction.</p>
            <p>For the life and power of godlimeſs wrought in the people of God by a divine principle, deſtroys all empty, carnal, and formal, and traditional outſide Religion in them, that proceeds from antichriſt, which proceeds from carnal principles of fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>The Law of God in the new nature, deſtroys the Law of ſin and fleſh in the old nature, with the very corrupt nature it ſelf. The life of God in his people, or rather God living in them, deſtroys the dead works of ſin and fleſh in them; the power of God from on high, being preſent in his people, deſtroys the power of ſin in them; the wiſdom of God in his people, deſtroys the wiſdom of the fleſh in them.</p>
            <p>The work of God in his people in the new creation, brought forth in them, deſtroys the works of ſin and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in their old nature, yea the whole body of ſin it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Yea the work of God in the new man, is the onely ranting principle to antichriſt, the whole myſtery of iniquity and man of ſin; for it makes it all flie in pieces before it; even all the groſs darkneſs and corruption, and filthineſs of the fleſh, with all the falſe light in the fleſh and ſpirit of man, with all empty forms and carnal obſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all goeth down when God appears in his people, in the brightneſs of his coming in ſpirit and power from on high, in the hidden man of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:118122:45"/> And now where are your Ranting principles, and carnal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty you ſo much ſpeak of, to fall upon thoſe that obey not your carnal Ordinances? it falls altogether upon time-ſervers, outſide-profeſſors, ſelf-ſeekers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not upon thoſe that worſhip God in ſpirit and truth.</p>
            <p>For the Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to light in the ſouls of his people, teacheth them to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live godly, righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent world; and this proves Ranting principles to be nothing but the whole body of ſin, which is contrary to the divine principle that God brings forth in his Temple; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed of throwing dirt in the face of truth, and of ſlandering the Grace of God ſhed abroad in his peoples hearts, the onely principle of true holineſs and righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Do you think nothing can keep us from Ranting principles, but a little cold water? why then have ſo many that have gone under water, fallen alſo under Ranting principles?</p>
            <p>Obj. 23. <hi>Several baptiſms were uſed in the primitive times, and water-baptiſm is nowhere forbid in Scripture; therefore we may uſe it ſtill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the truth were not a myſtery, then antichriſt might underſtand it: but God is pleaſed to declare the truth in a myſtery, that ſo thoſe that receive it not in the love of it, may be blinded, and ſo given up to ſtrong deluſions to believe lies; as it is appointed for the antichriſtian world, man of ſin, and myſtery of iniquity, 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. in which the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian world is deceived and blinded, even to this day.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth one baptiſm unto the Church of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Eph.</hi> 4. 5. and doubtleſs <hi>Paul</hi> would not leave out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptiſm <hi>(viz.</hi> water) if it had been any one bond of the true Churches unity, ſeeing he doth reckon up ſeven, which are a perfect number.</p>
            <p>And that we may not be miſtaken in the true underſtanding of this baptiſm <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, he ſatisfies us what bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. for by one ſpirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles; whether bond or free: and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. So here <hi>Paul</hi> bears witneſs to the one, and onely baptiſm of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118122:46"/> New-Teſtament, which witneſs is enough to ſatisfie thoſe who are ſatisfied with the truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, that baptiſm ſpoke of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. is one baptiſm of a ſort; and that this is the meaning of the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, this is more then the word declares, and ſo we have no ground to build, where there is no foundation.</p>
            <p>2 If you make an addition unto this part of the words, [namely one baptiſm] and put in this word here [one of a ſort] then we muſt put this word unto the ſenſe of all the reſt of the bonds of the true Churches unity, mentioned in this place. And then we muſt read it thus: One body of a ſort; one ſpirit of a ſort, one hope of a ſort, one Lord of a ſort, one faith of a ſort, one baptiſm of a ſort, and one God of a ſort.</p>
            <p>And now let all that have eyes to ſee, behold the groſs blindneſs, and more then Egyptian darkneſs of this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable interpretation of the word written. I believe none that owns the truth can own this blinde Expoſition, except it be thus, To turn the ſhame of fools upon their own heads, anſwering them according to their folly.</p>
            <p>And ſo this one of a ſort will amount to thus much, that there is one body of Chriſt, and another of antichriſt, and ſo one body of a ſort. There is one true eternal Spirit of the Lord, and all that are joyned to the Lord, are one ſpirit in the Lord; and this is the true ſort of unity of ſpirit, or in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Again, there are many ſpirits of antichriſt, and all that are led by them, are ſpirits of another ſort.</p>
            <p>There is alſo one hope whereunto believers are called, and this is hope of the glory of God, not of, or in creatures or things.</p>
            <p>There are alſo hopes of other ſorts, and theſe are that mens opinions and ways ſhall ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo one Lord unto the true Church of Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom they deſire wholly to give up themſelves to be ruled and led by, though other Lords have had dominion over them before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:118122:46"/> There are alſo Lords many, and theſe are of another ſort, and they rule over the world and carnal Church, that is made up of forms and ſhews of godlineſs in will-worſhip, in forms of godlineſs, without the power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of theſe there are many Lords and Rulers over the poor creatures, though they ſee it not.</p>
            <p>There is alſo one faith to the true Church, wherein they believe all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 24. 14. but they cannot believe any more but the teſtimony of God, notwithſtanding they are accuſed of hereſie and blaſphemy as
<hi>Paul</hi> was; but there are Faiths of other ſorts, for there is one faith of the devils,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 2. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith of the ignorant world, and another Faith of the carnal and and antichriſtian Church, though a blinde Faith. For they dare not believe the Scripture but as it agreeth with the judgements of men, and ſo they have a mixed Faith, built up upon the traditions of their Faiths, and theſe Fathers are of antichriſt with a witneſs, and of another ſort.</p>
            <p>There is alſo one baptiſm, into which the true Church of Chriſt are all baptized into one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. and this is that ſort of baptiſm wherein all the true Church is made partakers of the name and nature of God, and this is the onely true ſpiritual baptiſm of the New-Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And there are other baptiſms, and they are in the fleſh, and upon the outward man, and taken up upon falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and falſe and carnal underſtanding the Scriptures, and theſe are outward waſhings, as were before the ſubſtance came, as was water-baptiſm; and one ſort hath no example nor precept in the world, and the other maintained from a carnal underſtanding of the word.</p>
            <p>And ſo there is one baptiſm of a ſort, Spirit-baptiſm in Chriſts kingdom, the true ſpiritual Church: and water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms in the world and carnal Church. But here I would not be miſtaken, for I hope many that are under water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm are of the true Church of Chriſt: but not from their being baptized with water, but as they are baptized with the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, There is one God, but as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118122:47"/> the words, it is one God of a ſort, and ſo we will keep to your interpretation [one of a ſort] but this will quickly be anſwered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there are Gods many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is cleer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
            <p>Again, That ſeveral creatures do ſet up ſeveral Gods, this is generally declared in the word.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That there is but one God to true Chriſtians, is as cleer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. but unto us there is but one God, and ſo you may ſee the extent of your Expoſition of this place to maintain your own opinion, it declares your ignorance, and will-worſhip.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But to proceed farther in anſwer to your Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is a cleer proof in the Word, that water-baptiſm ſhould be left; and I believe you have read it in the letter many a time, though you never underſtood it. The place is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. a place you bring to prove your point, though it be cleer againſt you, as all may ſee that are not blinde.</p>
            <p>For obſerve, the Apoſtle here takes off the Jews from thoſe Principles or Doctrines of the beginning of Chriſt, which we have a teſtimony of, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. at the beginning of the chapter, <hi>Leaving therefore the beginning of Chriſt, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms</hi> (or baptizings) <hi>and of laying on of hands, and of reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and eternal Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Doctrines are to be left, by the cleer teſtimony of the word, verſe firſt,
<hi>Leaving therefore the word or Doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. the ſubſtance of this place lieth in this word <hi>leaving,</hi> and alſo in obſerving what ſhould be left; the Doctrines to be left, are theſe ſix before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi>
2.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, we muſt obſerve, that this place cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as men have expounded it, for they ſay theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines muſt be taken up of all Believers, and ſo they muſt go on to perfection, and leave them behinde, or not continue in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Expoſition is exactly againſt other Scriptures; and therefore this cannot be the meaning of the Apoſtle in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118122:47"/> this place, as we ſhall ſee further in going over the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as they lye in themſelves apart from mans Opinions, for truth is to be tryed by it ſelf, and not by traditions of men: let us therefore conſider of the things ſpoken of here, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of other teſtimonies of the Word.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the Doctrine of Repentance from dead works, which was the Doctrine of
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>Marke</hi> 1. he preacht the baptiſm of Repentance, he baptized with water, an outward and legal waſhing that did ſignifie another manner of waſhing and Repentance to follow, for his was but water, and could not change the heart and minde (but an outward waſhing, and outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) he onely declares another to come, which was the ſubſtance, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that was Chriſt in ſpirit, in whom Repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be given, as we have a teſtimony, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
            <p>Here is the true Repentance we are to look upon, that is, perfection it ſelf, even Jeſus Chriſt exalted: but we are (or they were not then, and ſo not we) to look any longer upon an outward waſhing and repentance from <hi>John,</hi> who was but a forerunner, not the ſubſtance, but to look unto him in whom repentance and all good is to be had.</p>
            <p>But that Doctrine of Repentance taught by <hi>John,</hi> was not to be laid for a foundation again, after the ſubſtance was come; much leſs to be builded upon.</p>
            <p>2 But now to the ſecond thing, and that is Faith toward God, and this is to be left alſo; but now what ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhould we have from the Apoſtle here, if this were meant of the life of Faith, that Believers do live here in the world in? he muſt then here overthrow his other Doctrine concerning himſelf, and other believers; and that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Hab.</hi>
2. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. &amp; ch. 3. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38.</p>
            <p>This Expoſition overthrows all theſe, with many more: for how can it be that we can leave Faith, and yet live in it, by it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:118122:48"/> But that Faith that was to be left, was this, that the people ſhould no longer wait for the fulfilling thoſe promiſes of God concerning the ſending Chriſt to fulfil the work of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his people, which Promiſes are frequent in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle well knew, the Prieſts and great ones had blinded the people with looking for Chriſt to come ſtill, and that that was not the Chriſt, but a deceiver; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid that Chriſt ſhewed himſelf alive after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by many infallible proofs, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle takes them off from ſuch waitings and expectations of Chriſt to come.</p>
            <p>We have alſo a cleer proof of this Faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21. <hi>but we truſted it had been he that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> here is a proof of the peoples waiting upon God and truſting, which is believing; and this is Faith in God or toward God in his Promiſes, which ſhould be fulfilled; and when it was fulfilled, then they were no longer to wait for it to be done; but to go on unto perfection, and ſo look upon this work perfectly done and finiſhed.</p>
            <p>3 The Doctrine of ſeveral baptiſms were to be laid aſide, or left, as there were ſeveral baptiſms and waſhings uſed in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>And they were now onely to look after the true and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual waſhing and baptiſm of the Spirit, as he declareth to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 12, having their hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure water, this was the onely waſhing the Apoſtle deſired ſhould be aimed at amongſt them, now the ſubſtance was come, and all other waſhings and baptiſms that were legal and carnal, ſhould all be left; as <hi>ch.</hi>
9, 10, &amp;c. there was no foundation nor footing for any ſuch baptiſm to be laid again; therefore it was to be left all.</p>
            <p>4 The next thing that was to be left, was laying on of hands, for when the gifts that followed it were ceaſed and at an end, to what purpoſe ſhould it be uſed? therefore they are much out now adays, that think to ordain men by laying their hands upon them, ſeeing they leave them as they were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118122:48"/> before, for the gifts of the Spirit do not follow: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is but like a dead form, where there is no life nor power, as in other forms.</p>
            <p>5 We come now to the fifth thing that was to be left, which was, of Reſurrection from the dead, but this cannot be meant the Reſurrection of the body, which ſhall be at the end of all time, when the Son ſhall give up the kingdom to the Father, and God ſhall be all in all,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that ſhall be the higheſt perfection that ever creatures ſhall enjoy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expectation of this Reſurrection, and the Doctrine thereof ſhall not be left behinde, for we cannot leave the higheſt perfection behinde, and ſo wait for a higher, the word written is cleer for this, that this Reſurrection is to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly expected and waited for of all that have good hope hereof, through the grace of God revealed in them, as in <hi>Act.</hi>
24. 15, 16 <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 30, 31, 32. with many more.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle bids us here leave theſe Doctrines and go on to perfection: but we are always to wait for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we ſhall have in the Reſurrection, for we cannot be paſt the Reſurrection and perfection, before we come to it.</p>
            <p>Therefore this is not the Reſurrection we are to leave wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and go on unto perfection; becauſe perfection is here, and we are not come to it, nor have not yet attained unto it, therefore not gone paſt it: nor have we yet been in it, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it up, nor left it behinde us.</p>
            <p>But now let us conſider what Reſurrection the Apoſtle doth here exhort the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> to leave the expectation of, and the waiting for the fulfilling. It is the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead; this was the Reſurrection that was then paſt, and therefore the people had no ground to look for it to come, and therefore they were to leave that Doctrine which did hold forth the Reſurrection of Chriſt to come, and they, as well as we now, were exhorted to look upon the work of Chriſt perfectly done, and Chriſt riſen and become the firſt fruits unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for there was no perfection of the work till Chriſt was riſen, and if Chriſt had never riſen, the work had never been perfected, but we had ſtill been in our ſin,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118122:49"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 14. 17, <hi>Rom,</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 31.
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14, 15, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if we ſhould wait for this Reſurrection any longer, we are antichriſts with a witneſs, and take Chriſt for a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as the old Jews did.</p>
            <p>6 Laſtly, We come now to ſpeak of eternal judgement that was to be left; and here alſo we muſt take heed we do not miſtake, as in the reſt of theſe Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Now as Chriſt had undertaken to encounter with eternal judgement, and had tryed the utmoſt what the judgement of God could inflict upon him, and had born all, and ſatisfied God, and ſo conquered ſeveral judgements due to ſin, and ſubdued ſin, death and hell, and all enemies that were againſt us, and was riſen in token of a full victory over all;</p>
            <p>Now the people were no longer to wait and look for this great work to be done by Chriſt in time to come; but look upon Chriſt riſen and glorifyed, and having finiſhed this great work of eternal judgement, and ſo to leave that Doctrine which declared it to come: and look upon it perfectly done, waiting for the effect of it, even the deſtruction of ſin in them.</p>
            <p>But in this ſenſe we are to wait for eternal judgement ſtill, which is the effect of Chriſts conquering eternal judgement, and this is the final deſtruction of the body of ſin, rooting out and deſtroying all ſin and evil in the elect of God, for whſtm he hath deſtroyed and overcome judgement, ſin, death, and hell, and all enemies.</p>
            <p>And now though we are in Chriſt more then conquerers, yet we ſee not all enemies deſtroyed in our own ſelves yet, but we are ſtill in expectation of the deſtruction of ſin and death, which is the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed; and ſo though eternal judgement ſhall paſs upon all corruption in us, and it ſhall be all eternally deſtroyed: yet we are ſtill in expectation hereof at preſent, and therefore not paſt it.</p>
            <p>So here we ſee, in what reſpect we are to leave the Doctrine of eternal judgement: and in what reſpect we are to look for the fulfilling of it.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtle would never exhort the people to leave that they were never come unto yet, and alſo that which he doth cleerly exhort unto in other places, this were the way for the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118122:49"/> Apoſtle to be like thoſe whoſe words were yea to day, and nay to morrow, contrary to his own words and practiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19. So this is the beginning of the Doctrine of Chriſt that was to be left, and this was the Doctrine and whole Miniſtery of
<hi>John</hi> the baptiſt, as he was a fore-runner of Chriſt, as <hi>Marke</hi> 1. the Miniſtery of <hi>John</hi> is called the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Repentance from dead works, that <hi>John</hi> taught and impoſed upon the people in an outward waſhing, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reformation, and outward Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was no longer to be reſted in, for now Chriſt was exalted and made Lord of all, and a Prince to give Repentance indeed, and true and real Remiſſion of ſins, in ſpirit, life, and power, which ſhall never be repented of; but men might repent of a fained Repentance, as might be taken up from any outward form, or outward reformation which was in fleſh, not in ſpirit, which is but a ſhew of Repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now that Faith that <hi>John</hi> taught, ſhould now be laid aſide, which was, that the people ſhould according to the promiſes of God, expect Chriſt to come after him, and ſhould fulfil all that was teſtified of him concerning mans ſalvation; and that he ſhould ſuffer for ſin, take away the ſins of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that now they ſhould no longer look after a Chriſt to come, and ſo live under types and ſhadows ſtill<hi>:</hi> but now they ſhould look upon all the promiſes fulfilled, and all finiſhed, Chriſt having ſuffered and riſen, and is glorified, and now they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all fulfilled that was promiſed of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 18. and not to look for it to come, as before they did, though the chief of the Jews would have blinded all the people if they could, to wait ſtill for Chriſt to come, and believe no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Johns</hi> teſtimony was, that he baptized with water, but there came one after him that was before him, and was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer then he, and that he ſhould baptize with the Holy Spirit, and with fire; yet at that preſent the people were to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his baptiſm, which was water, becauſe the other baptiſm was not come: and he did figure out the baptiſm of Chriſt in his baptiſm. But when the true baptiſm of all baptiſms was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118122:50"/> come, then they were to leave all the former that were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and truſt wholly to that which was inward, and the true ſubſtance of what was figured out before. And here you ſee there is Scripture for leaving out ſome baptiſms.</p>
            <p>And there is alſo Scripture for the continuance of one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. there is one Baptiſm, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is declared by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf; and therefore Spirit-baptiſm is ſtill in force, though other baptiſms were to be left.</p>
            <p>And ſo of the other three mentioned here, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and now where is your practiſing theſe Doctrines, and yet leaving of them? ſeeing ſome of them are not to be left behinde, while we live upon the earth, or are in the body, or live in this world; and now let all that ſee truth in its own light, behold your blinde and traditional interpretation of the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, wherein are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which thoſe that are ignorant and unlearned in the myſtery of God, do wreſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but obſerve, here it cannot be thoſe who are unlearned in the wiſdom of the world, for the greateſt learned and wiſeſt in the wiſdom of this world onely, are the greateſt fools in the things of God. But to anſwer an Objection from <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Paul</hi> was no babe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he did not leave the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, nor of Faith, <hi>&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5, 17. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 26.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore this is not that kinde of Faith, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is here ſpoke of.</p>
            <p>Obj. 24. <hi>Chriſt himſelf was baptized with water, therefore it is to be practiſed by us, ſeeing he hath left us an Example, and we are bid to follow Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Are all things that Chriſt did Examples for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in? then we have example from Chriſt to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed as well as baptized.</p>
            <p>2. Chriſt ſaid to <hi>John</hi> that he ſhould ſuffer it to be ſo now, that ſo he might fulfil all righteouſneſs: but not one word of Chriſt by way of Precept, that it ſhould be an example unto future generations to follow it from his example of taking it up. But ſeeing Chriſt did not ſpeak one word of the ſtanding of it in his Church to future generations, we have no ground to follow it now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:118122:50"/> So theſe be all the Objections that I do at preſent know or remember: but if there are never ſo many more, I know the truth is able to anſwer them all, though I could anſwer never a one.</p>
            <p>And I know nothing can ſatisfie the Spirit but God; and when God is pleaſed to appear in mens ſouls and ſpirits, in his bright coming in Goſpel-light, life, wiſdom, and power from on high; then men ſhall be ſatisfied with truth alone, and not before.</p>
            <p>And here I do conclude this Diſcourſe, humbly deſiring all men, that they would not deſpiſe the things they know not: but try the teſtimony of all men by the truth alone, and not try the truth by mens opinions, for all are to be tryed by truth, and not it to be tryed by them.</p>
            <p>For at the beſt, man is but a ſervant to the truth (and it were well if they were ſo much) but no man is Lord over truth.</p>
            <p>And here I have declared unto all men what I have received from the Lord, in witneſs to the truth.</p>
            <p>And here I do profeſs in the preſence of God, Angels, and men, that if I could ſee any juſt ground from the cleer teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth, that water-baptiſm were to be practiſed in Chriſts kingdom by Command or Commiſſion from Chriſt, and that it were the baptiſm of the New-Teſtament, I would not be one day older before I would take it up, I am ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for all the Commands of Chriſt, through his preſence dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in me in ſpirit and life.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I ſee ſo cleer ground againſt it in all the Scripture, and no cleer ground for it, therefore I have no ground to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, no, though all men were for it.</p>
            <p>And thus I leave what I have here declared, to be tryed by the truth alone, knowing this, that whatſoever is of God, ſhall ſtand in the day of tryal, and whatſoever is of man, ſhall be burnt up, for God will bring a conſumption upon all fleſh, and the Lord alone will be exalted in his people in his day of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in them, in his coming in them, in light and life; and then all men ſhall ceaſe from man who is vanity, and his works of nought.</p>
